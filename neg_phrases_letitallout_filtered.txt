 this week will be the first week so i don't expect her to miss her to much just yet
whoops
 i'm broken and alone
  i can only seem to remember the one that involved an outburst
 somehow i'm still here
 they won't take me to see a therapist anymore because the last therapist i went to didn't help me
 but i could tell they didn't want me sitting with them
 she doesn't need to have to worry about me too
 but have it known i did the same to her
 that was strange
 i saw my doctor about it
 my brothers would be pissed
 oh my god
 she then spotted a man in an orange suit and told me to run after me
 and not what others expect
 isn't such a failure of a human being doing everyone a favour by taking herself out of their way
 i don't think i'd even leave a note
 that i was not meant to be on this earth
  i'm not enough
but i did kind of flip my shit on her
 i have re-evaluated my maturity and unblocked everything because i know i am a survivor
 i knew she often ran out of minutes so i didn't think much of it
 and i thought i had it covered when i gave myself more insulin before i went to bed
 im just desperate to keep myself occupied at the moment
 she had been committing self-harm
the weird thing is that i work in mental health
so i guess this is already point two
my shovel
 they were all coherent
i thought that my childhood was normal until about a month ago
 there are times i don't want to hang out with friends or family just to get a"fix" i'm at a loss
 my screen reader slows down to a crawl and is barely able to function
 i can't bare to see happy families who have vacations
 i still have my dentist here
 i've made it to my 30s
 nausea
 still a long
 i will try to respond to in the next entry
 but their gravestones and family grief is very real regardless of what the numbers don't say and government tries to cover up
 i didn't feel the dark cloud over my head that has followed me for so long
 please have someone who can see describe the screen for us
 i get so sick when i get too close and that's not fair i have to be 26 and be so dead afraid of a school i left when i was 14
 i can't say i'm on a holiday i have no money and i don't even drive to say i'm on a local get away
 i don't think i can get any disease just from close contact
 i don't know what's wrong with me
 i don't even mind spending over an hour combing every burr out of her mane and tail
nothings really changed
i use to think this friendship was a two way street but even before she started work things were starting to feel like i one way street
 and i witness this sickening show too regularly for me to handle
"still confused"
 to any one
sooner i hope
 but no
 i'm a manipulative bastard
 i am no good
 i should probably add stop sleeping 10-12 hours a day to the list
every single one blabbed
 but i need to get over my mortal fear
 but i see he's losing his patience
  so i texted her about it
 am i crazy
 i lost 65 pounds
  then we drifted apart pretty fast
chronic pain sucks so bad sometimes
 then failing multiple classes
 naturally
 what exactly did i do wrong
 she reluctantly agreed with me
 it wasn't any more than i normally would have done when she was talking to me
 it's changed a lot
 i just wish i had someone anyone that actually wanted to talk to me
 as i said
 and explained to her why can't make the appointment
 out of spite to them or because i was spoiled when young
 so i would never give her up
 18 month license suspension
 he's getting desperate)
 i think they cause most of the anxiety
 the thought of suicide is tempting not just end it all but to not feel so used up anymore
 i feel damn lonely
but i think every on has their limits i'm sure and i can't help but feel i'm being taken advantage of a bit
i hate her
 i call it like i see it
sorry if this wasn't the right place for this 
 when i am with my horse
 and won't listen when mum tells her not to chase the dog around the house
 its like everytime im alone dark
 he said he doesn't know how to get rid of them
 stopped therapy and meds as my doctors kept cancelling my appointments
 much worse than mine
 i'm just in a lot of pain
"i know what you've been doing
 it has 305
i've spent all week trying new methods of getting a new pc because this laptop is fucking horrible and does nothing but give me grief
 i don't know what to think about all of this
  i have yet to have a friendship out here
rant over~
 it's more a problem that i don't really see myself getting to know any people outside uni either
 i just wish i wasn't me
so i need ideas as to why i can't do this and i can't think of any so if anybody has some ideas  please share them with me
 and he's build me up from the bottom
 but i'm okay
 just hope i dont have any panic attacks or piss off other people with my moods
 really struggling financially
it is like an endless battle within me
work
 i had told the ear doctor about my fears and she was really nice about it
  and maybe put up a sign telling students how to complain
 my issues aren't fit for someone who isn't a professional
 i dont know what to do
 some of them are laughable
 look hes upset with you
 eat pills
i am just sick and tired of people disapproving of everything about me
i started to get excited when i saw 'suicide
 now have no reason in the world to care
 i haven't talked to a doctor about it since then
 i do not fear death
 when i saw her picture it triggered me so much all i wanted to do was do the same to my body
 i probably make another thread
  i didn't tell her specifically to keep it a secret
 and my boyfriend too
 i'll always want to die
 i have to be the mediator
 (technically legally you're not allowed to let a dog loose on public ground though) but no one ever comes there
 but not to people that know me 
 i want to cover the whole range
ive been tearing up at my desk for hours now
 just seeing myself shutting down and getting away from people already and take down that fence in my mind that has built in to keep things running smoothly and voices at bay
 and asked if we could do it
so uhm
 tonight i'm bawling
 but i kept a brave face
 and she stopped responding to my texts
but sorry is only a word and not comforting or helpful
 but i didnt realize she wanted to go hunting also and didnt think i had the energy to do so
so this person got her own horse
 but if i try to look into the future i just see the same void i expect to see in my past
 i know but it doesn't make it any less real but please tell the anxiety that
 they always disappear when my grandpa tries to get them
 at least we don't have to be alone
 whether extreme or moderate or mild
 i don't know if i've done the right thing by telling them
 why
 helping my mum extra in the kitchen so my mum would get less frustrated about my aunt
 geez
so if i'm so awful
this year i've started to do things for myself instead of trying to please others
or she won't listen to me about somthing
 i was conversing with a friend of mine
 the other problem is that on top of the fact that i feel like a failure
 i've distanced myself from everyone again
 i don't know if i should leave or stay
 but my aunt never remembers to close the door behind her
 and has a horrible way of managing thoughts
 tired of anxiety and not being comfortable in my body
 this boy who i knew came up to me and asked if he could sit with us
 people i could talk to when i was down and count on them to pick me back up again
 i'm off to the geek squad at bestbuy
 at school
 because there wouldn't be enough time to talk with people anyway (also most don't even live in my city and just commute here during the semester)
 i barely ever go out
ps: i'm not new on the forum but i have been inactive for more than a half year now
 let's just say he did things that no man should do anyone  let alone to a child
  later i found out my parents had lied and knew of my upcoming move
 that i wasn't aware of immediately because my statement comes in a format i can't read
i find it hard enough to say what i need and want as it is
 he must be tired of you
 i'm tired of feeling like this
 not sure how
 small things like me going to get her coat from my mum's bedroom
 fear
 and physically ill due to workplace bullying
 here i sit alone in my darkness wondering how i became
 it's really painful
 ever since the media got involved
 disgusted with my body i was
 or even miscarried
 but yes i know i must trudge on because things will get better
 because it's just how my body naturally is
 hug the cliff's but i wouldn't dare put other people in harms way
 but it's not like people go there to talk with other people and get to know them
 well i fucking know that
 on the other hand
 but currently i'm regular like clockwork
 it's in my ear and my other teeth hurt
 i just never got them refilled
 i wish i didn't feel like such a failure
 because theirs seem entirely biological or chemically-based
 though i already think i might need much more than that
she wrote the hold and i eventually left before police could arrive to stop me
i was out shopping today and happened to glance into a full length mirror
 but when it comes back
  and all of this i would like to end
 but never anyone my age that i could actually trust
 i know there are no answers
i don't know what to do anymore
 i take pills every 5 hours
 i sometimes get angry
 i am so tired but i cannot stop
 but everywhere i go failure is my outcome
 is it too hard
 i just signed a lease to stay through july 2017
 i tell them how i feel and they tell me to suck it up
 last year was the peak
 if i survive until then i will graduate in a couple years
 nothing i attempted could manage to bring my focus in long enough to be productive
  been trying to go through with the day keeping myself busy but sleeping wasn't possible when thinking of her not breathing or being warm next to me anymore
 my mom is always drunk and puts me and everyone else down
 two women had found the road and decided to walk it with their tiny dog
it has been awhile since i have posted
i want to get off the ride now
 but my mental health has in all honesty worsened
i visited and had a meeting with a young woman there over a month ago
 when i explained the problem
 why is that so hard
 2016
so why waste precious oxegyen
why am i always the one at fault
i just wish i knew what to do to stay safe
 two days ago i guess i crossed a line trying to hug him
 and even if i have to leave in a body bag
 and by then i will have just killed myself
 but it turned out to be a cruel lie
 my anxiety kills me
 i want to be
 i guess i mainly need to vent
 i also don't trust the so-called professionals and am also skeptical of how effective the medicine really is
 the damned thing crawls under the door
 but others can get crazy drunk
not sure why
 and there is leave me the eff alone
 ticking something off my really long bucket list
 really when i don't have to go to uni i don't go anywhere at all
i am shaky and afraid
 people have tried
so my dad rang me today i screened the call
 please dont give up
 called down
 no longer as simply the whimperings of my poor depressed soul
 everything looks/feels empty and futile
 i just want to enjoy life and those that are in it instead of dreading every moment of it and being scare of death to begin with
 still get picked on from time to time
 if someone is coming to visit and i have to give my tiny flat a good clean that takes a week
 i have basically come to terms with being 'that kind of stupid'
  it still hurts even now
 i went out last night to a pub for a drink
 when it happens again
i feel like garbage
but yet i still ride this horrible ride
i'm only pretty to desperate or drunk people
 since i was very young i've had this big dream to have children
 after i found out she blocked me i did the same for a few hours
 or just didn't want to get this on paper (or whatever you call putting it on a website/forum)
 on top of it all he made me work on a site where i had to talk to horny men with all sorts of weird ideas in their heads and entertain them for money
 oh god
 but this doesn't make me get to know people at all
 he's the complete opposite of the idiot
 i know there's no answers
 i don't need friends though
 this day may not be special to anyone else
 however
i have a scoliosis and only got the diagnosis a couple of years ago (because no doctor was allowed to examine me when i was a kid and a young teen
  she also told me that counsellors can sort of put false memories into people's brains
we stopped talking after that for a while until my counselor at the residential treatment program encouraged me to forgive her
 doesn't ask whats wrong
 most days i wouldn't even call myself a â€œgood personâ€ù
 i had a really nice ear doctor as a kid
 meaning i was forced to use the stairs
  i find it hard not to be upset at that
 my heart racing
so i need advice on how to be assertive with my needs
 but to shun and spread hate towards skinny girls in the process is disgusting to me
 i feel alright most of the time
 a worthless piece of shit
i know it all my fault for letting myself get walked all over and not being able to say no
 at the same time as i have my next appointment with my therapist
 my md tells me that gp (gross profit) is the same as margin
 i guess my eyes weren't awake yet
 and i am afraid they would be right
  will let more out later
i provided this pos reference with the reasons why i'm choosing this new opportunity
 ive been clean for months now
 this anger is seeping into everything
 i even cried as i fell asleep last night
  she was the new kid nobody knew and i was the weird kid nobody liked
 my aunt sent a text saying the guy had faked it all
 go home'
" um
i don't remember how long after that the next part happened
  been forcing myself to eat for the baby and already i feel huge
the insecurities are the worst though
just "whatever" right now
 she is going through a lot right now anyways
 aware how badly they were treated and how they do not exist in official statistics
 people in the department do not like her and i have been sticking up for her
 tired of myself for being so weak
 although i wouldn't be opposed to the occasional table game when on vacation or something
 and i had to use a lot of mental strength to just wash them
 and i can't talk to my family about it
"why didn't you tell anyone
 i told my references to expect a call
 i'm alone anyway and have no family except my dog
 i want to actually smile again and mean it
 i'm just beyond frustrated
i finally talked to my spouse yesterday
 i'm just ashamed that i let myself go like this
 i don't want this anymore
 i would starve myself
  future worry but i know how i get when there are gaps in therapy
 and dealing with people looking weird at me when i take elevators just because i don't look sick
  i'm not sure what made me think that
 i was really nervous
i went home
 so i was off of them for 6 days
  i found out she'd lied too
 i should be organizing my lecture notes
 he just laughed at me
  but now i can kind of laugh about how hard she must be trying
 i had people i could speak to
 or at least not hit me
 but i can't
 my brain is really hurting
 lonliness
 i won't ever do that again
 he started playing a game like being silly and hiding behind signs and stuff and then running past me
 only for her to bring it up once again
one of the last words she said to me while we were still a couple was "why did you have to ruin a perfectly good thing
 i bought an 8gb stick of ram and am hoping that fixes the problem
 she could have just talked to me rather than ignore me for the last few weeks
  we worked it out in the end
 that i was not getting better and should allow others to care for me for a little while
 i even cried and screamed a bit
 2 pots 3 pots coffee doesnt matter
school is almost over(in 2 weeks) i dont think i can call for an incomplete and i am spending all of my energy just trying to just stay alive
 even if they just are using me for help now
but i got out
i'm twenty-two years old now
miserable
i'm paranoid as hell about it all but im doing it
i have $10 in free play at the casino so i plan to go down there and run through it and whatever i have the end cash out
 afterwards
  because i really need to laugh about this
 no im not in any immediate danger but i wish i was
 i know)
 i would likely do it
 i got up though and got slightly productive
 i want those days where yeah
 i know i just want to be at home but i can't because i'm babysitting and will be for tonight and the next two nights while my friend and her partner at work
 there's nothing outside to be afraid of (except a public panic attack) i'm tired of no motivation
of course my back and hip wouldn't allow that ro happen
 i say no and people won't respect it
 i don't want to die really
i fail to understand why my landlord thinks it's funny when he's had multiple complaints about bats getting into this apartment
 on everything she could possibly use to contact me
 yet i don't want to do it
 i thought today would be a bad day
 i don't want this
 if possible and focus on laundry
 when its the last thing i am thinking of when i go to bed and the first thing i think of when i wake up
 i eat all the time
 but it wouldn't matter if she didn't
  so now she posts a ton of photos of her doing yoga on her horse
 the sound it makes when this happens is like none i've ever heard
 i had written myself a promise that i would not make it to my sixteenth birthday and even though i tried many times
"stop
 other times
 but the earth's axis does not get demoralised or suffer burn out or need to eat
 and i haven't seen this friend anywhere
 the one person i thought i could trust the most
 and when i do
  she broke me down
 my name is kaitlin and i am surivivor
 i am haunted by the dead and the stories they told
 i'm insecure about my personality: i feel like i'm annoying and sometimes off-standish
"don't play your games with me kid
 and it feels like its getting worse
 right now my mouth is full of sores which are very painful
 even though it's just another shitty day
 i can't tell audrey about how i feel
 goddamnit
 another thing i am wondering
 then told them that i can't have anyone else knowing
 it comes back
  i can only remember bad ones
so while i don't actively seek out any methods
i hate their sexism homophobia ableism ageism racism
 or at least struggle with it
 not what other people expect of me
some of you know i am having a really hard time feeling like facebook friends don't care about me at all
 i'll exercise for a few days but then lose motivation
just venting - 
 whenever i try to explain this to people
 and one of them has digestive problems
 i wish i could
 and so ill
 things are so bad at work i forget what i've done a few seconds after i've done it
when i got home i just started crying and just started talking and cuddling with my rabbits and cried
 this regret has flowed through me like poison
 pathetic really) show you a picture of me killing a puppy or something
  we didn't spend a lot of time talking
 i am just a thin girl in general
 people like me don't want to be persuaded to live we just want help in ending it as it's so painful to live this life
 i'm tired alright
 i'm still just a disgusting twig in their eyes
 why would you fake your own death just to get attention
 tuesday i can clean the loo
 i test people that i know
 my friend has a job now and don't get me wrong i am so glad that she does
 i don't even know what to do with my life
i just hate the life i have and i wish i could take it away without failing
 i'm just over a week free of self harm myself and i will celebrate every single second of that
  i'm trying to get better and i am
 because my birthday is on monday and i wanted a night out
 which i feel like is a different sort of tired
 i think about the same bad events that happened in the past and worry if similar things will happen in the future
i won't though
 today i am almost deaf on one ear and partially deaf on the other
 but in the end
 it was one or two months ago and i was so depressed i wasnt even able to wash my face
i am exhausted
 i imagine things beyonds these walls
 so yeah"
i feel like i have always been taking care of them
 but i have no idea what you're talking about
so i feel like medication isnt the only cause of my problem but it makes my mood very worse
 it hurt more than anyone could think
 i want to go drive as fast as i can in the mountains
 i have ad/hd and focus is hard to come by as it is but the inability was novel
 they give me meds for my physical condition which has no effect and i have not got out of my flat in over a decade
 and the doctor added that it wasn't supposed to hurt
 this is the twenty-first century and she can do as she pleases
 i've accomplished nothing in my life and i haven't been happy in at least 10 years
 i'm also sick
it's like my entire world has been turned upside down
i keep having these repetitive negative thoughts that are making me depressed
  she also told me that she would have never left me alone so this can't have happened
 that time of the month always feels a little extra weird for me
 it has been so hard not knowing what to do or say to him
 i feel like i need to kowtow to everyone's demands
 i have nothing
 headache and what i thought was food poisoning
 which is nothing
 possibly pick up a breakfast sandwich or something on the way home
 the only time i feel better is when i reach a state of numbness
 they sent me home with shots to give myself
 and what was i met by
 why do i have this weird duty to live
 i hate myself for that
 do skinny girls not have feelings
 but can you tell me what's up
 i couldn't imagine hurting anyone like that
after all this time
 it even looked like she had a hint of disgust in her eyes
 the past month has honestly been hell for me and i've relapsed with self harm multiple times
 cos after all the only reason i want to get out is because i'm in intense pain
 he'd probably already reached home at this point
 but still nothing came up
 i don't know why people think it is okay to bully me
 so he wasn't that much of a worry intelectually
 turned up the music in my headphones and stared out the window
 un-exaggeratingly apathetic
  trying not to give back into behaviors but just so hard when i feel this way
 why was i such an idiot
 and it took me about two week to build up the courage and say i could only do a max of 3 night's a week
  i feel like maybe we could grow apart and i don't want that to happen
  well i don't like it
i only seen him two days and not even  whole days but now i cant visit those places without thinking of him
 and referred to my friends as "assholes" even though she knows none of them
i now have a stupid desire to eat more junk food and to actually gain weight in a massively unhealthy way just so i can get those judgemental eyes off me
"it just sunk in"
 how low can you get emotionally
 am i borderline personality disorder
 i hate life
[so i decided to make this diary because i wasn't sure where to talk about all the little things i feel and minor things that happen without spamming threads
 but i'm waiting for a reply and i am just imagining all of their emotions as they read it
 unable to change focus from all of the pending threats in my life
 i guess i got more negative towards the end
 i'm  20 now and due to rumors about me at my previous college i had to take a semester off and have really cut communication with everyone because of my worsening anxiety and trust
 but i am left now feeling achey and tired all the time
 rather i came back because i am actually doing good for sometime now and just wanted to reread how badly i was doing before and the feeling of doing okay now is something precious to me
 because i don't want to upset the apple cart
 and if i wince in pain or stretch she gets worried
 the cats are not allowed in there
 every single one of them did the exact same thing
 i could go and get henry out and she would go herself with the cans
 not relapse into drugs
 i was about to cry from pain at that point
 she goes through it too so she has herself to worry about
  i confirmed nothing and denied suicide plans
i can't even let it out i'm over repeating myself
i just feel so awful
and lastly the feeling very lost part
 this is why it doesn't pay to talk
 i don't understand myself
 i can't even explain how i feel right now
 and she said she wasn't sorry
i just want to scream
i've found out my great aunts don't like me because i'm not fully black and don't even "act" black
 i hate this
it's a struggle to do anything and i don't even see the point
 that snore
 in my case it's mainly physical pain and feeling trapped that makes me want to die
 and so maybe it needs more ram; but just for the hell of it
 it's all coming back to me  i want to find a comfy rock and hide under it
  i still struggle with the thoughts
 i've been just pretending to go
 after all
 impossible
 cold
 i don't know what
 since
 that i classified as "friends"
i'm new to the whole thought of actually opening up about myself and being 100% honest
lost a few friends once again and feel others pulling away
 but know i cannot help but come off as needy
 i just know i'm going to end up alone again
different ways have been going through my head all day
 he informed me that a friend of my cousin killed himself recently
 i am currently in therapy with a therapist i trust and i am waiting on dbt to start
 ritalin and concerta here
 i try to tell people this hurts me
  i always had it in my head that he came with this grand toy and took me  kidnapped me because
 was released from the hospital about ten hrs ago
 when i look at the problems "normal " people have i'm envious
 do the dishes
 out of adherence to an abstract social pronouncement
 depressed
 he did but just as i was about to click the leash on him he ran again
 i still can't talk to people
 i'm not good enough
i decided i didn't want to do that
 i'm tired of feeling this way
)  if something big comes up or i start feeling severely suicidal
 and i'm sad all the time
 i should be learning more for my exams
 i guess
today i took a shortcut home from the store that lead me through the train station
 i usually piss through it
i haven't been on this site in a while now
 i want to numb myself and shut down and hide forever
 but sometimes you have to certain things
 on friday
 don't plan on it either
 it lasts the entire day
 i hope
  but she sure took pictures
 so depressed
grrrrrrr
 i'm getting to the point of wondering if anyone even sees me as a human being any more
 i have me
 of course not
 maybe for awhile which is the main cause
35 = Â£100
again sorry if this is the wrong forum i just needed to get that out
i go to bed angry and wake up angry
 and she told me she felt like i wasnt treating her like a friend like she was inconviniencing me
i try everything that i can to get the girl
 and they would still assume that my skinny frame was to do with some kind of mental illness like bulimia
  failing 8 and 9
 i'm rambling
 and i was still tired
 does anyone relate to this
i haven't been on here for a few years
 but dear god
 and why now
 friends
 i have tried to get help
 currently i am under 340â€_i think
 i was actually looking forward to it
 but the same feelings are there to torment me
 i'm tied of everything about life
 in the first one i dropped out after only 2 months
 i just want to get everything off my chest since i can't open up to my family or friends
 she says i'm not allowed to discuss my feelings with anyone
i am always scared of saying what i need or thing for fears that nobody will like me
 that i could make it down the stairs
 i know there is a diary section on this forum but i wanted people who felt the need to give feedback to be able to do so
 i've been insecure all my life
 i've been a burden
 not that any of you probably care
she asks me if i am a rape victim or not just because i dont want her to touch my ass
 "can you tell me what's on the screen when this happens
 but i guess thats how its supposed to be
it's all just to pass time
 he doesn't like touch
 they were eating
 this would be known as â€œtiltingâ€ù
 and this paradox is the only one that exists
i'm the lonley girl in the corner
realized that i forgot to take my meds yesterday
 i guess i mentioned it a couple times already but i really don't see a nice feature anymore
 what happens if the landlord refuses to do anything
 i am a person now
  i mean
 can i see a different doctor then please
next issue
 why on earth would she
i don't have anyone to talk to about it
 to feel that feeling
 i bet everyone didn't care about the fact i couldn't give a fact but it stayed in my mind and i kept thinking that they were all staring at me and judging me
 i know what's going on
 i've taken my meds and still cannot calm the hell down
 and i am sure i told her i wasnt sure i could physically walk around all day
 and i never want to turn into her
 10 methods to die'
 i have barely been able to keep my eyes open
i'm feeling down and kinda want to hurt myself
 i'm scared to walk the halls without being pushed over or insulted
 i try to lose weight and i just fail at it
 i don't know him very well at all
  (even though i know it's not really her fault
 some of my friends didn't like him but i wanted to be nice and i had nothing against him so i let him sit with us
 i'm feeling very sorry for myself tonight and feel like i want to cry
 a pain in the ass to everyone here and i admit it
 just saying
 but i can choose to let go a more 'normal'/'right' way but just pulling my sh*t together
  i just don't think i'm cut out for a job
i know that i will hate myself after this
i'm having a really bad day
  facing minimum 90 days in jail (likely 6 months)
 i've spent most of the time trying to fix myself and others
once the anxiety raises then all else spirals
 guess because the thread said "let it all out" so i'm trying
 but with my depression i just don't seem to have the time to just â€œtrophy huntâ€ù like i used to
 i know i would be after the weekend
  been struggling with eating without feeling so sick
 but the instructor was a physiotherapist and she assessed me one day when i showed up at the class in bad pains
 she was in too much pain that i could not justify keeping her in this world any longer
 depressed and suicidal
 so scared of falling because of my screwed balance
i don't know if this will trigger anyone
 if i'm sad
today she touched my ass again and it just made me really grossed out
 where he would easily be found
30/11 during the week night but later friday's as he is a chef
 but for the most part i'm emotionally dead
 i got put next to 3 other girls who i didn't talk to really
  it's like they don't feel they exist fully if they aren't documenting every moment
 nothing helped
 i am 26 and i have those irrational fears sometimes still
 so why waste a scan on me
 i came for my back
 my guess is that something is bogging down the memory
i've been having an extremely tough time lately
 i worry myself
 she told me i did indeed have a slipping disc in my spine
in a way i think my period might be a trigger too
so i went to bed 'early' (meaning midnight) because i have a therapy session today and wanted to have some sleep behind me to help me be more robust
 just doesn't make sense any more
 i get slapped in the face
 in my case
i'm stressed
my life has been grasping for courage for hope for fortune
 just had enough of it all
 they won't love or befriend me
 and she couldn't even take out a single bag of garbage
 if you see someone sad everytime
 it was even worse when one came through the light fixture above the shower
 who cut me out of his life without empathy or explanation
 i don't want to burden the few loved ones i have
  i've been dead for so long
 she realised what she was doing wasn't the way to go about things (not a serious case
 that get carried away
 i hate their strong efforts to make people who arent like them second class person
most of all i hope that you never get let down again
 hell i'm not doing so great right now
thats it im so fucking done with it
now i just feel used
 then laugh at them with contempt and scorn when they come to me for help
 it's bad enough to deal with these demons on my own
i am not supposed to be okay today
 i'm done
 i have it when they stare at me in places
 but at least once a week fantasize how wonderful it would be if my doctor told me i have a terminal illness from which i would die within a month
 they say i'm just lazy and a liar and all this stuff
 people on some forums suggested me i should be looking into clubs and all
  i see therapists
 i feel disgusting
 i know she recognized my voice
 but looking at how far i have come in just a year i know i can do this
 in reality i may simply be suffering from depression
 what is that
 if i fail or not
 i have my fingers crossed that doesn't happen
 believe me
i just wanna have a fucking relationship with them
i'm sorry for venting so much
 obviously since that can't happen i just have to deal with it
 the place looked like a trash heap when i got back there
 i'm not at home but i will weigh myself and update it
  i texted my friend about it 
  one of the two i've been torturing with talk of suicidal thoughts recently
 i know he doesn't love me
 but i'm tired of life
 but it's nothing more than fatigue
 i'm so tired of this depression and anxiety
 i can assure you
and don't get me wrong i know some of those activities bring success enjoyment at fun and some don't
my blood-sugar was running high all night (i have type 1 diabetes)
 i could tell her anything and everything going on and so much of me wants to scream to her that i am still here today after all of this and revel in my accomplishment
 with me starting therapy and opening up so many bottled things and so much abuse; the last thing i need is to fulfill others expectations
 i have no motivation
 am i just a target of everyone just telling me off that i don't know about
 run
my feelings are constantly broken when it comes to a girl things
i was one again avoiding by changing my aunts subjects
 i am tempted to when i feel better and see what it takes to get into an acting school as well
 i hear
 i'm apparently just not allowed to have anything that makes me happy
i used to go crazy and hit her like i am a kung fu master
 chatting away
which leads me to my other former/ lost friend
a totally useless human
 but i think the sunrise might have woken me
  my heart is going to stop and my brain is going to explode
  i have been as far as having plan and date time to complete it
  now i feel a little guilty about the disbelief somehow
 but i'm hoping that i can also find some reassurance and hope
 and normally when i say stupid i am talking about some emotionally driven decision or action - and i am that kind of stupid on an almost perpetual basis
  just whatever
 i hit a fucking wall
  i'm just "whatever" i had enough
 wish these feelings and thoughts would end
 in case anyone is worrying i'm not actively suicidal because i still have some kind of irrational hope
i am just having some weird thoughts on top of it
 she'd seemed fine no more than 5 minutes ago
i can't say anything
  in my case
 i have no other choice left
i have depression and anxiety and it sucks
 but not because i was feeling down again or that im thinking of killing myself or something
 most wouldn't understand anyway
but suddenly the dog ran away from me
 i can't run because of my spine and hip and tried to command him to stop
 nothing seem to have much meaning for me 
 the doctor who saw me at the psych er a couple of weeks ago said i probably had the flu after checking my vitals and for a few days i did try to take care of that
 just low on energy and things in this house isn't going well
 i just couldn't stand up for myself
 silence all night
 i didn't say much back
 it scares the shit out of me and causes me to not want to leave my house sometime
  this person has not just facebook going
 i wanna go back in time and scream at my past self for what i did
 i may not have anyone in my life right now that knows everything that happened
maybe
 a cop-out
 i'm just tired and weary
 i spend my days talking to my ldr boyfriend
 i even threw up before sessions
 i can concentrate
i can't even cry
 life is full of disappointment and empty gestures
 i always feel like i'm going to make a mistake or make the wrong decision
 i've never been to see a professional about the way i behave
 my hip hurts too
 probably won't be much but i like to play the $1
 going for a walk
 i had hoped at least she could take a message or something
 because until now she was never the sort of person to bring another person down for something as superficial as looks
my neighbor asked if i wanted to return cans with her and go can hunting
 but i don't
cold
 there was no notes anywhere saying it was out of order
 and i feel like i can get things done
 he talked me into coming home but i refused so many times because i just felt like saying goodbye to everything right then and there
 though she said they're just friends
 i don't know
i meant to start this sooner but i just didn't make time for it
 so i try to stay off of here as much as possible now
i feel like i am caught in this cycle of severe depression/anxiety climbing up to "okay" or even "good"
 or so and so pissing her off
 i feel like no one takes me seriously
 no one really asks either
 no-one said a word but i caught one of my friends staring as i quickly put on my pe jacket to cover them up
 i guess i would feel guilty if something bad happened to them
 i've been called a shithead
 i walked after him
having someone that close to me  pick at my flaws really has made me feel even more naked and exposed to everything and everyone
 even if i do not have a job
 the toy doesn't exist 
 i kept getting more and more pills
 over six weeks
 being big doesn't help the pain
 not run away
 these could get to become novels
 it started a few weeks ago with the flu that developed into sinusitis and tonsillitis and i ended up on antibiotics and steroids
 but i'm just tired of the darkness that seems to surround me
 so why does this behavior continue to happen towards me
 just going to try to rest
i'm tired
 but how will they know when he is really in trouble if he cries wolf like that
 i've gotten to the point where i don't cry anymore
 i'm sick
 so maybe try my hand at interior decorating
 but it also made me angry that he would do that
 but it's a fact that in soon a year i only got to know around 5-10 people at uni and i don't really consider any of them to be a really close friend
i genuinely feel like there is something wrong
 from extreme to "moderate" wishes
 i know i could go to the library
yeah
 i started the call off by explaining that i'd probably only be able to provide limited information because i'm totally blind
  i was terrified at the thought
 sharp smoke enters my skull and i just feel like banging my head hard against a wall to make it stop or even better just chop it off
 but she gets offended
 she hardly has time to talk to me
 he's my only friend and honestly
 because i knew that there would always be people in this world who would be judgemental and ignorant
 but i am willing to try anything at this point
 asked her if she was mad at me or something and just not returning messages or what
 whatever
 this is goimg to be a weird thread maybe but i want to let it all out
 and nasal congestion
 nothing more
 i know nothing that happened to me is my fault
 but i do so much
i know most of what i'm thinking is irrational but it dosnt mean i can stop the thoughts no matter how much i tell myself that it still dosnt stop it
 i'm not smart enough
 i can't talk to shannon
 none of what i said was hateful
 he pushed me away and stated as he likes to that he's not going anywhere
so yeah
 during one session mum managed to drag me to i was covering my ears and screamed "don't touch me
 i'm alive
 going crazy
 clean the house
 with an instructor who was not an actual psychologist or therapist
 i'm very bitter about my situation and just want to not be here
 see potentially abusive partners everywhere (b) i don't even really know what i want in a relationship as said it probably would be just stupid right now (c) i'm absolutely boring
 since he had supposedly done it in a public place
i just need to vent about this
 i hate starting conversations and they always made me start
 ive mentioned it to my therapist
 or me annoying her
)  plus there's at least one other person she calls her "best friend"
 what else have i been ignoring
went to the hospital for pain my back
 and i have been having paranoia
 it usually starts off in my mind as failing a class
 why on earth would she feel it is okay to do this
is to be emotionally neutral
 or weren't strong enough
 even though it was all jokes it hurt me and i just wanted to be left alone
 i also explained that their website is no longer accessible with a screen reader
i'm so upset
 none of it was about me 
i want to help my friend out because i am that kind of person
 i'm afraid that one day i can't stand it anymore
 i wouldn't mind dating someone as boring as me but what are you supposed to talk with a person like that
 i invite that on myself for being unhappy
 why do i feel like i want to stay in this cycle
 it hurts
 i can have conversations with people about uni related stuff for hours
 or that i need to eat more in order to look "normal"
i tried to have a bath because i don't have one at home but all i could do was stress
 i didnt want to create this thread but now i feel like i have to
 the last time it happened was midnight a few days ago
 i am so afraid of losing him
 which caused me to have hives
who cries endless silent tears
 loss of appetite
 my legs looked massive
a long while after i tried physiopilates because someone online had said that it helped with her scoliosis pain
 this was simply a teenage drama
 monotony
 every
 i feel so sad and angry all at the same time
 it has affected my bladder function
 why can i not get my shit together
 when suddenly something hits me in the side
 exercise just feels like drudgery--go figure
 i hate being desperate yet it's all i feel i am
  i don't know how often i'll write here
  i couldn't endure it
by the time i realized i was in the wrong and tried to make amends
 except for my counselor every 2 weeks
  maybe i should attempt the pointless experiment of at least speaking out loud
i mean
 but no she will talk to him
 under one of the sessions with the ear doctor when i was around 10 he drained my ears with a very noisy apparatus and by accident ruptured my eardrum
 i'm really insecure about my looks and feel like i'm ugly and horrible and that no-one actually likes me
i know i have looked after this girl quiet a few times without her mum or dad around
i've had a not very nice tooth ache most of the day
 my friends say i can talk to them but i'm scared to because i feel like i'm bothering them
 i'm scared to put my hand up in lessons for fear of being wrong and being made fun of
 the only person i know with this was my mother
 i sat myself down on the side of the road
 she told me multiple times that i need time for myself
 i messaged her mother on facebook to help her because i knew i couldn't
 i bet you never heard of a poodle-horse before
 very short conversation there that ended in me stating that he doesn't like to be touched and he said "sorry"
 but as usual i stood by myself
  triggers come unexpectedly and without me knowing what or why
 way too go but my eating habits are getting under control
 i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up
 my uncle tried looking up the story online and couldn't find anything
 self exile any better
i work in academia
i don't know what tomorrow holds for me
my anxiety is so bad i feel reckless
 despite the fact i did also suffer from an eating disorder in my teen years
 i don't like bars
  i play poker a lot and sometimes i just make really bad decisions
 in fact
why do anything in our life's
 i don't understand
 they would probably think my irrational fears are laughable too
 in all this i don't have any time for myself at all and the crazy thing is that if for once i have time for myself i don't know what do anymore
 the thing for me is that being well isn't not thinking about suicide
people say i want to be depressed
 that's how i feel
 to stop it
 since all my eating disorders make it difficult to lose weight that way (and lets face it
i'm just so tied of feeling so miserable
  am valued by no one
 that's what the flu always does to me
i'm self deprecating
except more and more pain
 i then got a text shortly afterwards that my constant texting and trying to call her was making her uncomfortable and she wanted me to leave her alone
 it was too late
pffft
 outmaneuvered me consistently
 late at night
 i dont want to wake up but i cant kill myself
 i am always scared i'll meet someone who used to bully me
ever since birth
so i woke up at 6 am
 not looking for more
  i'm not laughing at her
 and eventually commiting suicide
 well almost never
 i am pathetic and don't even stand up to my own core principles
  i would like to start playing video games again
 that was two weeks ago
in my mind if one cannot positively and significantly effect a number of lives that sums up to a number greater than they would hurt if they were dead is a waste of resources
 i want to let go
i work overnights so i will probably head home to sleep right after the free play
 i wish i were normal
and then i listen to how they are because they don't know any better anymore and i'm not about to tell them i'm on the verge of suicide
 i honestly don't even know why i'm on this site
 "youre losing him
 she keeps being out all day avoiding being home
 damn
i'm tied
 i am supposed to fill my life with things i like to do
alone in this prison i peer
 but today i feel so down i'm not sure what to think of it
  she also doesn't know that i sh or have suicidal thoughts
 but what tops it off is when i am sitting on my bed
i wanted to give medication time to see if this effect would go
 and no man has control of me
 but first of all there aren't even that many at my uni and second as said i don't even really know what i want to do anymore
 however my doctor told me when i was 20 that i might not be able to conceive
 but instagram
  i started getting suicidal thoughts again
 i can't
 i'm unable to forgive my younger brother
 and even that hurts
 when i first joined sf i was barely 15 and hanging on by a thread
 i just want it to go away
also i was very depressed when i first started my therapy for adhd
 and i'm pretty sure my dad would be too
 i'm not really sure how to start this so i guess i should explain what this is and why i am doing it
i saw a doctor
  i've withered into nothing
 cause my brain dosnt seem to want to help with regulating feelings and emotions
we have only strattera
 my ptsd symptoms literally disappear
 i'm doing fairly well 
i came back again
 no pets
 i gulped
 i want to stay and look after my dog
 but freaked me out beyond belief
 and i exercise regularly
  i'm not special in any way
 depressed and anxious and that was what kept me so exhausted
 most people just hate going back because of learning
 i at least fantasize about the joy i would feel if i ever get a terminal-type diagnosis from my doctor
 i just really needed to vent before i cry at my desk
  i haven't tried in years
 i've tried medication
 he acts cold now when i'm feeling sad
 carly will go on a trail ride if i make her
before i started i said i could do a max of 3 night's a week
i have been so tired
 i have
 they don't think i can do anything right
 he kidnapped me and quickly got caught which lead to several events and 2 yrs later he took his life 
there is
 i wasn't built to handle life
 and while i understand what i think the reason was
 and my emotions are just like a yoyo and i can't control it
 my doctors doesn't seem to worry about that
 but everyone laughs and claps when a skinny girl gets the hate
 i always end up here
 i don't really know how to cope
 but they either stopped working
 i don't wanna harm myself because that's just gonna hurt more
 everything feel so meaning less
 but the thought of trying to leave the house to meet so many disappointing mismatched therapists until i find one i can trust and respect seems impossible
 i just dont want to feel this way anymore
  may have to call my dr in the morning and schedule an appointment
 and so i get anxiety in any social situation
 it will probably just be painful to look back and realize that i mostly wasted these years too
yes its scary stuff
i'm finally putting inheritance money to use and going on holiday by myself (well on a group tour thing)
 i can't blame them
 as i am homeless and really
 my mom touches me in a weird way since i was a teenager
 just in case someone was wondering
since i have no one
 the thing is i won't be busy i had to stop uni until next semester so i can't use i'll be busy with that
)  that was when things changed
 but he just keeps making passes at me
 i could barely walk
 but without the obsessiveness
 but for some reason
  my hopes
 i called
 bitter
 don't really plan on doing anything anytime soon
today i saw my horse
 either i am depressed one day or angry the next
tonight i feel i'm at my ends
 and suddenly i just felt completely okay
 she noticed i was off and asked what was wrong so i just told her i thought (and i did) she meant just returning them
 and before i knew it they had left
 they're a last resort
 and suddenly i realized i was having a really
 they also talked about other conditions etc and i told her i had un-diagnosed ptsd which also kept me inside a lot
 hoping that some driven enough and foolish enough lifts me from my willful trek towards hopelessness
 for at least 4 days the elevator has been out of service
 so what's the point
 then it seems like it's perfectly acceptable to throw insults around
 this is my second attempt at college
one the other side of the world
 it causes me a lot of pain and i'm so
 her partner is at least a 20min train ride away plus walking to and from his work or to the house
 but i feel like i am crazy
 the other actively recruited me for this position
 from having to battle to get up in the morning
 she just touches my ass and leave her arm there
 i know they aren't officially connected to the station (they just have their shop in the station building and sell tickets
 i'm trying so hard to lose weight
 my mom went along with me all these years talking about this dumb thing 
i spoke to my therapist
 i'll survive
 made me feel crappy
 i'm suicidal
and times like this
 and last night i spent hours curled up crying
 i didn't want to wait 2 hours for the insulin to completely take effect because fuck that
 i'm a fucken puppet
 you'll get tired of it
i don't even want to do anything anymore i just want to curl up and rott away in my unit
"i hate you"
my goal is to spend an hour writing every day for this
i try n think of things to do and then i get about a million different reasons as to why it's pointless and shouldn't do it
 lost job
today i got up and i skipped breakfast and spent my time in the bathroom putting as many different types of spot cream and dirt cleansers as i could as i have a lot of acne
 the second time i blacked out
 and even before i got her she didn't get saddled up very often for many years
' born of political spin and equally as empty
 strike one
it just undid what i tried to do
 about 15 minutes later these boys came up to us and started bullying him (like they usually do)
 needless to say
 after that i felt actual dread having to go there
i can't remember things anymore
 i'm so afraid i'll lose him
 33yrs ago so not like this just happened but 
 the scarring on my eardrums have messed up the pressure inside my ears
so how do you go about being more assertive so that what you say is actually heard and taken seriously
i'm unable to forgive my dysfunctional upbringing
 but there's no toy 
 by train
 i basically sit in the background watching everyone else progress
 but she's made me feel more lost than usual and i have only here to turn to for advice
 it bothers me also that any choice or opinion i have that doesn't match his will continue in the same question over and over until i agree
i am sorry i hurt you
 but i only read the return part
 medication
 no matter how hard i tried
 i can't go to any of my friends and burden them with this
who is hanging by a thread
 they cycle through doctors and medication and i cannot relate because there do not seem to be any real events they can list as long and terrible as mine
 i got really angry and yelled at her always
 she had a whole questionnaire and went through it with me
 it was bad enough when one was flying through the kitchen one night
 even my dog is depressed
 everything and i mean everything is just passing time until the end comes
 her reaction was to panic and get a therapist who considered putting me on a hold (i kept most details private)
 and i can't endure this
 no matter how much i wanted to
 she stops a lot
 please help
  then i told her that i went to a school counsellor and that memories started coming back
 and if you were skinny then you weren't a "real girl"
 i haven't drunk anything in a few days
i am so sick of this
i feel myself in post trauma
 i wasn't about to be a victim
 and i will get depressed again
 but he's fully aware that i'm gay and not into men
 he recently told me that he wasn't sure if he want to be with me
  things were a little rocky at first
 luckily he was wearing a brace so he was easy to grab and was just wagging his tail
but he just sent me a text
 i am afraid that one will bite me when i am sleeping or something
today is april 18
 but they do know that i do have problems with anxiety and being categorized as anything
 "i'm visually impaired
 what am i doing
it feels like an eternity
  i would like to curb myâ€_other gambling habits
 i'm really fed up with it
 i end up in a bad place emotionally
my doctor referred me to a center that was supposed to have some group sessions for people with chronic pains who needed to learn how to deal with it and settle with that life
 spending most days indoors and a lot of the time in bed i guess i don't notice
 and all of a sudden it felt like a huge hole punched in my gut and i i started sobbing and felt really really bad
 so i apologize in advance if it does
i did a lot of things to navigate through the day
 telling me when does she ever not drink her drinks
 i look for advice
 a job i hate that expires in june and no prospects of getting another job
 lied down and brooded for about an hour
or sometimes in the evening
 to me at least
 and just because i haven't gained the weight that people expect me to
 one reason i haven't done it yet is because it would hurt those who care about me
 sneezing
 i'm not about to tell them i have planned this out again
 fatally overdosed
  my parents asked me a few things
 it's not all the time anymore
 i hate easter 
 i feel everyone hates me although they are just thoughts i know
 i wanted to run out of there and cry but i said no i am going to stay and do what i have to do reminding myself that my weight is not permanent
 for various reasons
 other days i sit here and wallow in the fact that i am still alive
 i had to hide in the bathroom where it was now light
 i think it was 2005
 and i can circle the charges i wish to dispute and mail it back
 i should also be solving more exercises to actually hand in some every now and then (i'm so glad this is not required at my school
 i know a few things about anatomy and i was thinking i had a slipping disc or one being squeezed by my twisting spine
 i demanded reasons
 im sick of it all
so i made 40 fake facebook accounts
 that made me worse
 tired of looking for answers that lead to disappointment
while this has angered me for many years
 instead of having to force myself to get out of bed in the morning
 it shouldn't hurt
compared to the weekend this is nothing i suppose
i don't come on sf anymore until i get really down
 i have yet to do what i would call a serious attempt
 everything is my fault
 any suggestions
a bad day is like today
 each day seems worse than before with the occasional short(hours) reprieve
 i can't imagine how many times i have told her to drop and forget about something from the past
 yeah
 my eyes don't fucking work
 my feelings have been rather low-key of late
  my parents told me the next morning that it had been my best friend's mom saying that my best friend had told her i was planning something drastic
 i now ended up crushing on an anime character
 pulling/messing with my hair and saying things to me
 no one knows about the real me
 not even for work
 and i guess sunshine is healthy for you
  it's sent now so no going back
sooner or later
 considering the things i mentioned about my parents
 i might gain a pound
 she thinks that i am being influenced by "bad" people
so drained lately
sorry sir
 and i have been my whole life
 and it's very hard to exercise with this condition
 i know i shouldn't be a horrible daughter but i can't help it
 but to me
 my head gets so quiet
 and i haven't eaten anything for nearly two days
 i lock myself in the bathroom
 it makes me think of an addict in recovery who isn't using maybe
 you always here people say i don't care what people say when really they do and hide it but i really don't and honestly i know it's a bad thing
 it was just awkward
other words in my dictionary
 i am the peace maker and basically i make sure they don't kill one another
 but for how long
  i haven't really bought anything for it in the 13 months i have been here
 i would like to start saving it for something
it's now been a week
 never know what to say and definitely don't know what's going on in my head
 it sucks
 im barely ever content
 who was behind me
 don't really think i'll work at such a place
i am so worthless and not worth anything
 this song causes me to cry uncontrollably
 i really do hope i can bring myself to post regularly now that i have found actual freedom to do so
 if i didn't take out the trash
 cook or clean and for not having a boyfriend or even looking for one
 but nope
 i hate myself more than anyone ever could
 awkward silence because both people are boring as death
 i'm told i'm not unhappy because of  physical or emotional abuse nor my social awkwardness; and besides
 it's mild to moderate 99% of the time
i am panicked if somthing happens to her daughter as i don't have my licence so i dont drive or even have a car so in an emergency i can't really get anywhere fast
 he says he loves me but it seems like all he can do is focus on the negitive things about our relationship
 and i spoke to every single one trying to get this "information" out of them
 i don't wanna kill myself anymore because what's the point
 they didn't keep me this time
 the list goes on and on
 i felt sad for my cousin
i can't even get out all that's going through my head its just going so fast right now
 i still don't take chances
 i know it takes work to get well
 or even what i assume that they expect
so i reported my counsellor to his supervisor because he made me feel like i was deserving and responsible for the verbal child abuse that i told him about
 cold turkey
 livestreams and youtube videos
well i have 15 minutes so i guess i can talk about the battle plan for the day
i feel so pathetic as a human i have done nothing useful for anybody or for myself
 nobody will miss me
restless night of thunderstorms and rain
 i am in remission from my eating disorder and have been for almost a decade
 and after all of this to finally fall asleep just to have nightmares
i went to the kiosk
 i start throwing things at it
 and have a bad hearing on the other
 he hadn't noticed the dog
my sick back is acting up
 i have that creepy crawly feeling
for once i hadn't set my alarm
tired of waking up with the darkness of depression
 but today
 one was assigned to be my mentor
 my boyfriend refuses to make any decision for me
 which i will write about later in my diary by candlight
 why was i such a piece of shit
 i'm just sick of it all
 she's a lesbian so didn't think much about it
 trying to come up with reasons to get out
 was told 'its scoliosis
i really really don't want to do this thing called life anymore but i can't do anything about it at my friends house anyways
 she didn't seem impressed
i feel so isolated lonley and down
 the only one without moral grey areas
 if i was going to be exiled for helping
  and i don't necessarily mean the extreme where you actually have a method ready
i don't know how else to feel
 and it's making me so confused and tired but all i know is the times when i feel down are getting significantly for frequent and intense and it's scaring me
 i have always had really bad ears and have had so many infections and had to have operations to drain fluids
i can't even connect with others who suffer from depression
 i feel alone and sad and pathetic
 if it doesn't
i stopped taking my medication again
 now i feel so worthless
 i guess she means well
 it comes flying at me
 i feel like my mood is changing dangerously
 my heart goes out to all on this forum who are hurting
 i'm tired of the constant battle and see no light at the end of the tunnel
 just that i liked hanging out because it got me out of this lonely rut i'm in
 i was late
 i hate talking
 from when i was raped at 13
 washing the knives i was tempted to harm myself
right now i am unstable after a better day saturday
 which is hard to live with
 i couldn't read
 i'm sorry that i abandoned you
 and i should look at the psych clinic for their brochure and see if it was something for me after all
 i keep telling myself that
 i have tried being there for him but i don't know how
 shit i didn't even cry which is a first
 but i still have some misgivings
 well time to go
i think the irony here is work lies in mental health
  like that's gonna make me feel better
 i tried to stretch but it all only seemed to make me worse
 no nothing except a very aware brain that makes every second of this living hell feel like a million years
i'm waiting to wake up one day and be completely fine
 they didn't question it
 i felt the need to confess
 i would be a complete ass if i honestly thought he did
 i am sick of fighting
 woke up to a grey cloudy day a reflection of how i feel
the suicide/depression paradox hurts me
 spent 2 weeks on the psych ward after i was determined to be a threat/harm to myself
 i spend hours watching conspiracy theories and false flag videos
 and treated like crap ever since i was a little kid
 i'm tired of being strong
 what if she starts to miss her mum and i can't calm her down
i use to come on here all the time 
 what the heck
 took out her phone to get a pic of the road
 if no one likes me the way i am
im just a fucking ulgy fat mug that never get a fucking girl
 but i still dont know what i did wrong
 called the dog over; had music in one ear and calmed myself as much as i could and forced myself to look at the buildings
i feel such anxiety not knowing if i'm hated
 its not worth it
 i'm super insecure about my body
i just don't know what to do anymore and as i move forward i often find my myself contemplating how such an inability will play itself out moving forawrd
 along with the reasons i went into that specific crisis center are making me feel panicked
 i said i've already given up so much
 i can't sleep
 so i have no way of accessing crucial account information
 i mean im still here alone in my bed wishing to be dead
 i guess that's what depression is
 i guess i'm ok with not knowing too many people at uni though
 after they moved to north carolina about 3 years ago
  we used to hang out together
  sometimes i feel like she's only tolerating me
 people assume that i'm sick or that there's something wrong with me
so i did just that
 taking my bag away and hiding it
 i am still indescribily exhausted
 hopefully my husband can help me talk to the kids correctly
so i was walking home the other morning with my boyfriend at 7 ish in the morning in osaka
i just
dont even know what to write
 i hate the fact that i look at life so mathematically
and another thing
 wednesday i can clean the toilet
 i'm not sure i'll ever get it back
 and tried calling her a few times
 i know i can't work now
 made me feel like i was having seizures
just yeah
 i felt good for awhile then i wake up one morning back to square one
 even right now
 there's been times i wake up and pretend to still be asleep because i can feel him move my blanket trying to take pictures of them
 since clearly he needs help
 i am getting so sick of being treated this way and so i foght back this time and told her maybe she needed her ears checked
 don't know anymore
 life-ending
 losing money
 which is screaming louder
  obviously i don't expect anyone to read every entry since i'm sure on days when there is a lot on my mind
 but right now
 not totally but enough
 no friends whatsoever
what is this place for
 probably in a hotel
  i just got to remember to take my meds on time
 while i understand that she may have been concerned because she thought i genuinely wasn't eating enough
 why are photos so important
i miss having actual friends
 her other friend had finished exams
 but rather just the thought that you still wish that you could "go" pretty soon
 i sleep a lot
 so i just stood there like a maniac hoping he would come back but he didn't
 trying so hard to change myself
 on the other hand my stomach didn't kill me last night so i guess it helped a little bit
 if i could take a pill to rid myself of all emotions
 but i'm not allowed to anything more than walking
 seeing that written on this site gave me the biggest buzz in years that i might get decent advice
 she kept staring at me
 so i babysit when they are both at work
an hour later i went back to bed
 i only woke up after 1pm
 it's tearing me apart
just want to get this off my chest because i feel totally alone
 i'll crawl to the kitchen and get myself some lunch and my pain relief
  i would like to find the courage to meet people
  honestly this might be no more than boredom
and now i am alone
 but it wasn't
 she's not used to being ridden much
 i'm usually confused on my own feelings and have experienced many life changing events
 but after that things changed
i hate my brain its my own worst enemy
 then when we went inside for form i sat in my seat in silence and only spoke when my name was called out on the register
 but was just looking for some input on what the cause might be
 and he reassured me that i should be alive
  i don't know why
 i don't know  how to stop thinking of death or how it may be
 first thing he asks me to do is read something to him from my account page on their site
i'm the lonely girl in the corner
 but by then
  the first time i thought i was just being stupid
  however
 how do you tell this to people
 took it this morning
 but im stuck and i dont know what to do
 fuck my life
at any rate this is how the story goes
 i don't feel sorry for myself either
what the fuck is wrong with you
 then i get a text
 i've tried therapy
yesterday i think i lost my best friend
 if i even hurt anymore
  so far every love i had was a one sided crush
i made a list of 10 things i want to change to make my life better
 that i let that lonely monster take control of me
 but sometimes things can send me into an anxiety-filled frenzy that is difficult to come out of
 and lately i've been having suicidal thoughts again
 sometimes i feel it is better if i don't exist at all
 i am tired of being lied to
 afraid
 this term we were doing football  needless to say i'm horrible at pretty much every sport
 but what terrifies me even more is the fact that i am growing to accept this way of thinking as fact
 if you make a point to show everyone that you can do yoga on a horse
 and i checked my blood-sugar again
when i got to school and it was time for forms (20 minute registration classes at start of the day) i saw everyone else in my form standing with their friends
 i try so hard to treat my body with all the respect it deserves
 i just feel
 the last person who cared about me passed away last year and it's been a downward spiral since
 i feel like things will only get worse from now on
 i would direct you to other services but they have gone under
 as a college student under high stress
 this is hell
  i'd like to start saving money
 the more i get hurt
i am so extremely weary
 and i fell asleep early last night
 my self-esteem is horrible
 i can't look back at all
 i don't want to give people a reason to make fun of me
 i don't really grieve anymore
 i'm just venting
 but it just made me so sad
 it seems like there's no hope or anything to look forward to
 i guess it's stupid but maybe you can figure how desperate i am in that regards
really
 it's all my fault because i'm actively trying to be unhappy
  i would like to work on my poker game
 anyway
 the nearest i get to the sun is seeing it on the net
 i would have done a lot better if i had committed some awful crime and been doing time in a prison cos they let you have an hour of sun there a day i've been lead to believe
 i am trying to avoid medications
today was back to school after 2 weeks off
 i slowly picking the pieces of my broken self and putting my life back together
 i listened to it a lot when i was working my way away from my 'ex' idiot who abused me and forced me into prostitution
 you have to fit a certain list of diagnoses for that
 without help and disabled in my flat and ignored mainly by the state
 and is causing me mood swings
 but you can legally sleep in a snow bank
 he truly saved my life
 but as the title says
 as a grown woman and i felt just as sick
 or that i've dropped out of college because of it
 but not actually being known is the easiest way to do so
 everything i do turns to shit in my hands
tells me to lose her number
 i told them i was so sorry and they took it pretty well
 i have chronic pain
but yeah
 but i stopped only because i fear the pain
 i want to hit my head on the table
 withering
 months ago i saw my doctor again
i get the bus home
 i avoid speaking to alot of people
 dont want to
 but i just don't know how to state my needs again it was hard enough the first time
 if i don't have someone standing behind me and telling me what to do
 damn it
  now that i've realized that parts of it weren't normal
 my mom and siblings don't know about this
 well i shouldn't have another drink
 they think it's just all my fault that i feel this way
 like there is nothing wrong with it
tonight i'm sat here on the floor in my closet of all places and i'm fucking bawling
i know i should be taking off a day or at least half a day every week to rest and regain some energy
 i wish i could be less annoying
i'm just about done with everything
 and after testing every single one of the people that i had any social connection to
 it physically hurts to lift my arms to do anything like write or type and i'm really struggling with the physical stuff at work because i have no strength and feel so tired
 this is only scratching the surface of how i feel
unsure if i have the strength to get through this
5 year tried to commit suicide this past month
 she told me she didnt want to talk
 how do i decide to live again
needless to say
 but i realized that i probably woke up because my blood-sugar was still high--it fucking was
 every contact i had with her has been blocked
 i know what i did
i wish i'd never existed
she misses her dad when he's at work she always has but she has not been away from her mum this long before
 i can't really at the moment because i am broke until next my next paycheck (shocking
 i've had quite enough drama in my life
  i have lived in pittsburgh for 8 years now
 everything is so dark my heart feels black
 monitoring my diet is losing it's effectiveness in distracting me from my suicidal thoughts; it's just frustrating now
 isn't it
 oh god i dont even know what i want to say
 i feel lost as to what exactly is wrong with me
 (no one knew what had happened)
to someone whom i was very close to
 i didn't raise my voice
 unsure how to put it
 just seems like whenever my husband is off at work
 she means well when she says things like "can you handle that
 no less than 30 seconds after putting my phone down
 there has to be a reason
 i'm blind
 she still does
  how do you try again after hiding for so many years alone
and that crushed me for some reason which is ridiculous
but i can't shake it
 i am nothing
  so here's the list:
 then complaining i dont talk loud enough
 there's a road there and he's allowed to run on the field without a leash
 they don't believe in me
 a person i first brought out to the barn to help me with my horse
 letting them keep throwing words at me until the bell went for next lesson
 why i began to speak to inanimate objects
 even though i have no family that wants anything to do with me
 no one shows interest in me but i've gotten used to it
  a child shouldn't be scared that a parent might lash out at them
 usually involving some kind of math/data
 i had a fight with my roomate because she snapped at me for asking her a question as to wether or not she wanted to keep a bottle that was full of liquid or if i could return it
 no one asked
it worries me
 shit happens but it's not the end of the world instead of dreading waking up
 i see no future for what i need to do or what my purpose is or should be
so if i have something that costs Â£35 and i want to make a 65% margin i need to take my Â£35 and divide it by 0
 runny nose
 none of my friends had turned up yet
 i am trying to work against my anxiety here
so broken
 he said barbara
 and i hope if i write in this every day i will hold myself accountable
 suicide is never an option for me since i have my baby niece and sister who look up to me
 i don't know what trigger me to come back
 she kept asking and tried to dig into what had caused my ptsd
 she gave me a bad reference
 so a normal person might go to sleep around noon
 no idea why i'm writing this
 but it was all lies
 my alarm was set to 7
why do i feel responsible for my family
 i know what i have overcome
 i feel a bit weird tonight
 wtf
 kid
alone in this prison there is a door that never opens
 but he took me to his house 
 when i do
 but those two hours that i spent contemplating suicide felt ephemeral
 i sat at the bar and didn't say anything else to her
 i'm so depressed
 i have been thinking i was tired
 either
 the breed of horse that still runs in a few wild herds in the united states
  it is exhausting
 earlier if i go straight home
she was done with me
 but i met her on here
 so i knew i wouldn't be able to stop her
 my family are embarrassed of me and they have even said it so that is factual
she's just so busy
 i can only idle away so much time before i lose myself to suicidal ideation
 hollow
 i had been addicted to paracetamol as a teenager
but i'm just miserable
 i'm tired of trying to act like everything is okay and wearing a mask for others to see
 i need to be kind to me
 or even a friend or a neighbor
 i'll be in bed by 10am
  we didn't spend a lot of time together
 thinking it will go out the other way
 i made myself bleed a little not too long ago by messing with the scabs covering the places where i'd minorly injured myself a few days ago and thought about making some new ones
  if that means starvation and death well that is your own fault for some reason i can't fathom
 talking to him even about small things is extremely difficult because he has held a pattern
 but other days
 she didn't give me any until i broke her down enough to make her say something
 i eat
 i don't know who to talk to because no one knows i'm still seeing him
i'm easily pushed over my tolerance levels anymore
 but apparently it is
 empty inside
 i would stare at some form of written material and bounce my eyes from one word to the next but it was as though i was reading some foreign language
 am i really that annoying and such a burden
 they don't answer their phone
 i cleaned my freezer
" kind of stupid
 i tried online dating in the past but guess what were my problems (a) weird people on there
my mom is a single parent and i've only been back with her for the past 6 yrs
  not pictures to prove that you were there
gotta go
 i mean when you start talking and everyone just turns away
 lately fantasize about killing my self on an almost daily basis
 and i was just contemplative and feeling especially suicidal
i don't understand at all
  right now i have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet on my ankle and be on a curfew
 about me or another family member
 i went to an ear doctor a few years ago
 who do i contact next
  what repeats
it does make sense  now though
 but a lot of people seem to have no idea that healthy bodies can come in all shapes and sizes
 because she just won't listen
 any input would be much appreciated
 i feel very lost in my life and i know i have several demons to slay and i am hoping maybe someone(s) can help me find my way again or just tell me if i am going the right way
 waiting to go in
 obviously)
 lasting even just a day
 today i have the final proof; further loss of hearing
 palpitations
 a state where i mindless followed his orders
 really
recently
  i'm a lot to handle
 whom i was supposed to have an appointment with today
 despising what i see in the mirror just because i don't fit society's standards of what a "real girl" should look like
i just can't
 and i just don't believe that
ear doctors are another trigger for me
 or that the pizza man will try to come in my house and rape me
i can't seem to recall any happy memories right now
 and i think even try get sick of me some times
 eventually
 even writing this looks like the epitome of self pity
 i wasn't feeling impulsive--just ill-fated
 my partner is the sweetest guy ever
 people just want to tell me off or whatever
 and really i think she is just seriously sleep deprived
  i don't necessarily mean that extreme
 hugs them ect
 and i haven't been talking to anyone in general
  i won't have anyone to talk to
 i let everyone else's words get to me
 she had a "boyfriend"
 or smothering
  through most of my rocky college experience leading up to my move
 the wrong clothes
 through any means possible
but i'm still broken
oh my goodness i was not expecting that
 it's a really big sign that you're annoying
but my friend said she is going to take every shift possible and thay could mean her being away for a week or two at a time
hey guys
i just keep thinking too much
  why can't this stuff happens when he's home or when he's with me
 but i don't know for sure
 carrying heavy groceries
 first of all she left me a message and told me to come for an appointment on wednesday
 anxiety
 when your sick or not feeling well like you have lately
  it might seem silly
  i told her that i think a man touched me when i was like maybe 3-4
 i wouldn't mind answering a couple questions about myself but i guess it's mostly going to bore the other person
 i just bury myself in my video games
  i don't want to do things as well
" people aren't understanding today
 manipulated
 the therapist i talked to at the psych er a week ago told me that
 that i looked sick
but i didn't
 i mean
 putting weight on me as the only one to care for her
 but i had to stop for financial reasons
 not for long anyways
my best friend couldn't stop commenting on my weight when i saw her a few days ago
 but as i washed my hands i saw a weird shadow
i'll probably lie here and watch netflix instead of sleeping
 just because i need to take care of my own needs too
 my mum told me they were seeking a medical secretary at an ear doctor in this town
 writing and joking with my boyfriend who came online at 8
 i demanded explanations
 at this point i'm waiting to see to see something good happen to me for once
 which is a bad place for me to be
 (high school bullies)
 it's just too much and i don't feel like doing anything at all
 my mood the last few days has been dipping more and more
 (and avoided talking about the fight because i didnt think she needed to know nor did i care to talk about it) she told me ok
 broken promises
 i feel like i've gone back to my teen years
 everyone hates me
 i used to be a sun worshiper and it worked as an anti-depressant for me when i was out on my bike all the time
 i am beyond freaked
  now i'm struggling in my relationship with her again
 instead of understanding that i was trying to be helpful she ended up blocking me
 "just do it
 because i could eat as much as i want in front of people when i finally became comfortable with it
 i don't care if living like a robot would be worse
 even people who i thought weren't the judgemental type
i'm the lonley girl in the corner 
 which is of course my fault
 i cant take it anymore
 was misdiagnosed as several contrasting disorders by different doctors who didn't even attempt talk therapy
 i am feeling fucking done
 i was given a tentative offer which would become final once the reference and background checks were completed
 i could barely walk for 2 days after a session
 almost three months ago and for the past almost month i can feel it
 for some reason
 i dont want to die
 it is small and probably harmless
 ive not been cutting like i used to and that now i am keeping a good balance on my life
i have 'realized' i am still sick
 i don't know if it is because i am so simply so fed up with the feeling that i know what i want to do with my life but my current academic trajectory is nowhere near my goal
 when friends ask me how i'm doing i say tired
at lunch (after 4th lesson) i sat down
 i'm still so taken aback
 this is all to say that by that point i have not already relapsed into major drug abuse and am either in jail
 ever since i was a kid
 time
 the only exercise i'm allowed is walking
 i honestly know i will never physically harm myself i just don't see a point of hurting yourself while hurting
 i staggered down the stairs
that's why i developed voices
 the way i act and live is wrong
 if only i could see an end to it
 i've gone to her place a few times and we usually got starbucks before the barn
 i know i am able to not be in this cycle -- i did it for years so now i just need to let go
i am just so sick of having pains and essentially being handicapped
i am unfortunate enough to have an 'invisible' handicap
 fraudulent charges on my credit card
 having no one to ever go anywhere with down to the rapists family pestering and trying to draw me out to being extremely promsicuous when younger
so the problem is that i always feel so conflicted about everything
 i suppose it's cause easter just passed 
 but in this state of mind its so difficult to do any of the things i know i need to do
i have stayed away and yet i long to talk to you again
 i know i don't read things properly because i'm so distracted with pain but i really did have some hope there until i read it
 everyone watched me and eventually the teacher told me to sit down and went onto explaining today's lesson
i don't want to be depressed
 the more i care
 that void
 i don't want to burden others with my dark feelings
 i was on some for a little while
  i spoke to my pcp
 tells me that when she spoke with the other university
 "well (at this point
social anxiety and depression are destroying me
 it seems impossible to me but i am holding out a minimal amount of hope that someone could actually love me
so i told my mom that i had been feeling anxious this past year and had talked to a doctor
 but the truth is even if i was skinny i'd still have pains (yes
 i need to be up at 9:15-9:30 to get to work on time
in this day and age
 which is surely the opposite effect that people should be going for
 i'll just be a cynical
  i have limited interests and don't like large social gatherings; resulting in people having to choose me over their friends
loads of people i know are getting married
 sorry for writing all this shit here but it had to leave my head (although i don't expect it to not actually bother me again in like a couple hours or so you know)
i endured severe bullying in school too and even on the school bus
 i "do" say stop
 whether it was reading
 and whats hurting me the most
 and getting sick of being put down
 and on top of it i'm losing one of my best friends
 maybe a little less
 but it had been weeks of bad dreams waking up feverish thinking i was pregnant or had a baby
 i even hate hearing my name being called out for fear of being stared at
 especially after how poorly i treated it during my teen years
 the victim blaming rhetoric is really starting to get me angry
i can't take this anymore
 i got into doing some things for her
 ive told people before but it didnt get better because of it
 i wish i could exercise to help me lose weight
 so i decided that i would rather her be mad at me than for her to not be here at all
nobody sees or hears
 why am i the one "bothering" everyone else
in the midst of the feelings
on the other hand: people tell me that depressed and suicidal people like me are the worst people ever
 i'm sure it'll pass
i don't know how to say what i need amongst all this as i know they need the money desperately and as i said i am glad to help
 and if i am too active it hurts more and sometimes it locks nerves
 nope
i'm not expecting this newfound mindset to last forever
errrr
 in retrospect my life has been a constant battle with anxiety
 that should i fail
 my boyfriend of 3
 thinking back i am realizing i did all the wrong things
 either texted or called each other
 or at least i think they do
 i now hate the way i look
 god forbid i eat a cookie
 i will be subjected to the whim of fate
 and the thing was supposed to start on thursday
i always said her i dont want her to touch me
 there has been several dozen situations in the last month where i would sit down for a minimum of an hour and get nothing done
 i only have friends online
 it was the last time i saw my father 
 i just feel like i'm supposed to be a 'good girl' and get a job and work hard
 probably the prospect of another dark empty day
  to attempt to mold form to the erratic and crushing and mad-flailing pings and chokes and hiccups of emotional failings
 and then he came back after about 15 minutes obviously worried and was so confused what was wrong
 am i just dysfunctional
 instead of living them
 so i came out from that fight with my roomie to meet up with her and needed to get my service dog in training out (he had been couped up for 2 days) so i told her i would bring him
 not once have i judged someone for being overweight
 Â£35/0
 what do i fix first
 she managed to get pics of almost everywhere we went
 i'm stuck so stuck
 i tried to convince myself i would be fine
 i know that i annoy everyone
 they just told me what i had said
 since my last posts i've gotten better in some aspects
 they don't think that happens to a 26 year old
 but this
 i just feel so lost
 lie
  i know it takes time and know what to do and avoid
 i "do" speak up
 yet when a girl is underweight or even just a bit thin like i am
  but i need to start this thread to laugh a little
 monday i can vacuum
 when my aunt was complaining about stuff i found the silver lining
 i've been on blood thinners since the last time 2010
 part of me wishes i had never discovered this
i feel so much regret
  cleaning isn't going well and my kids don't care
 i don't know if it's just that i am lazy
  i asked my best friend about it and she said her mom must have gone through her phone
 i'm just going to lay in bed day and night until i waste away
then when i got on the bus to go to school i started shaking and crying quietly because i was so scared of going to school
3 months ago i was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol a second time
i'm worthless
 this is why i am afraid to call my psychiatrist
  speak to no one
 i go up into my room and started vibing to some gorillaz
i feel so empty
 and social anxiety but i hope in time things will get better
 so we were pretty much destined to pair up on the first project of the school year
 i just can't take it
 where i feel nothing at all
 i've since deleted her number
i also feel like my mom is closeted lesbian so she kinda tries to satisfy some of her repressed urges
 the point is
 they are paying me minimal amounts and i'm not doing it for the money it's just a bonus for me
 good guys sink to the bottom of an abyss and are left to die
 just that
 at least for a few hours a day i can take my mind off of the bitter hatred i feel towards everyone and the horrible thoughts that fill my mind
 mostly because i am one
 they would still look at me in disbelief and dismiss the idea
 these are the times when i feel i am ready to do it
carly is the biggest slow-poke of a horse you ever saw
 no response
" or do stuff for me
 and whenever i try to gain it
 should i go to the doctor if the thing just landed on me
 i shouldnt have to mediat between emotions and my thoughts
 and still now he can instill fear in me
 i don't really have a life after all
when my friends/ former friends picked me up in the car
 i tried them all
 i have severe ptsd and cannot cope right now even though dbt is helping me some bit
 should i stop medication or should i call my psychiatrist
 i'm losing my mind 
 (sorry if squeamish guys are reading along) but my period was irregular for years
 and this entire town feels like a trigger
  all you were doing was causing me to go into hiding
 i've been fighting this wave of depression like there's no tomorrow
 but i feel sooooo bad about my self tonight
 i even went outside while waiting for it to finish
 i get paranoid about crazy things
  foods are making me more nauseous
  it was very awkward
 i took all the acting classes i could in school
 and it is eating at me
but that was never why i was referred there
 it's downright mentally cruel
 micky
 i just want relief from this constant state of exhaustion
 she had no reason to add her unwarranted 2 cents
i am sitting at my desk trying to calm myself down and hating myself for being stupid
 the dysfunction of my current department has nothing to do with my potentially new job
 my mind screams for suicide but my body cant do it
i feel some minor relief in pretending that i'm valuable to somebody
 nowadays i wake up go to school then go sit at the marina and stare at the ocean there's nothing poetic about it i just get bored
actually bad week
 hoping if i was someone might like me
i got my coffee and greek yogurt
 or am i in the wrong
 she was the sole reason i still existed
 she said that was fine and wouldn't expect me to do it that often
 can't can't
 many in fact that has proven to me that talking is ineffective but its what i'm supposed to do right
but i don't want to mess up your life
 meds
 it has certainly affected my capacity to write and sleep
 i wish i could actually do something right for once
 well all students get anxious about stuff
 i even got scolded for not overcoming my anxiety from my mom
 and i have to run out of there
  this lack of anonymity
 and never any concrete plan or course of action
 that i'm making everything about me and that they really don't care about me
 if my profit is 100% but my margin in that instance would be 50%
 you're all good people and i'm sorry you suffer this curse of depression/anxiety and all the other mental tortures that have descended on you
 it was a horrible meeting and i left it shivering and almost cried on the street going home
 this has occurred over the course of 4 months
  a child shouldn't be told they are stupid and bad at certain things
 i thought i just had experiential trauma from all of the dysfunctional family relationships growing up
 or refuses to go in a straight line
 he's been really patient with me
 one to one therapy wasn't for me
 while grasping ice cubes tightly in my hands
 my classmates would think that my small frame was entirely due to the fact that i never ate
  why would it be any different if i tried again
 lost home
i have been very panicky for the last 24 hours
and i really don't need more excuses to stay in my flat and not go outside
 i feel like a failure
  always had a counter argument
 he said he is in a weird place and is confused
i've been having a strange issue with my new laptop
 and since then i didn't even take aspirin for bad period cramps
 i woke up a few hours later
i wasn't even a human being at that point
 i just don't want to be alone
i'm beyond exhausted
 but i refuse to let it be the end of the world
 i should maintain a clean room and more funny stuff in the next point
what could i do to feel better
feeling exceptionally depressed
 he's getting old
 and in the end she decided instead of the chronic pain curse she wanted me to join an anxiety group
it's odd to say
 anyways
 i was being stupid
 and not just to live
 but it goes in one ear and out the other
 and no scans
 i hate looking at myself in the mirror and seeing my ugly
 which was made worse after a friend killed himself around 1 month ago
 i'm not crazy
 wish i could feel optimistic but the depression is so heavy on my body and mind
 i felt for him a bit
 i don't have the courage to make that final commitment and i don't have the courage to live
 that's the worst
 and i just kept sobbing and it wouldn't stop
 he actually reached the women and i managed to call out to them that he's not dangerous
 there are so many ways to let go
 spotty face
 apparently she is
 but that's not the point
 i have been devastated since i spoke with my pos reference this morning
 after being depressed and in treatment for over 10 years
 but i actually gave up on it around 8 months ago
 like
 i feel terrible of myself
 but yet it is so difficult for us to feel the same way about ourselves
 and especially since the last time i saw my therapist
 hope to get through the rest of this pregnancy okay
 you've been head****ing my daughter
 after three years of being mentally and physically beat down
 i can feel the pain inside
 i'm so lonely
 i haven't been talking to anyone specifically about my depression lately
why i never get laid
 yet i still crave having somebody that actually wants to talk to me
 it was a relief when i finally got it
 everyone was really shocked
 so i sat by myself
 but she's like so
 i don't help myself much
  i knew something was wrong right away
i heard crying in the background
 trash
carly's basically a mustang
 there 2 elevators were out of service
 my mom would be heartbroken
 fuck that
 i cried for a couple of days after hearing that
 i've yet to self-harm since december
 so completely devoid of companionship
 another thing i am sick of is the looks people give me when i go for an elevator at all
  i fear death when the suicidal thoughts aren't there
 we had been out drinking together the night before
 not something i want because i would like for him to relax and rest after he's worked all day
 cant go either way
i'm not sure if this is the right place but i didn't really know where to put it
 followed some time down the line by an eclipsing depression based in the fact that my life has become the punch line of some tragic joke
 help me or even talk to me
 i lived off of toast i'd crawl to the kitchen to get
i don't know
  all i do know is they both hurt they are screaming
 do people think i am incapable to make my own decisions
 which i did
 so it does make me hopeful
 wet the bed while i slept
 i'm basically incapable of maintaining a conversation
 i don't even care if my girlfriend comes over anymore
 he took me to hurt my mother 
 the alternate fate of my mother
 but doesn't do that with me at all
brian
 my tummy was sagging down
 and i thought i was doing a good job on at least keeping the suicidal feelings away but now they're back
 when i got to my uncle's this morning
 it's supposed to be every 6 hours
 i let him back in
 always ends the same
 it's very frustrating to have this label pinned on me for as long as i remain thin
 only to fall back to severe depression/anxiety
 there are people like me who are desperate to go
 just wanted to complain with a post
 we got into small groups and did dribbling practise but i felt as if everyone was watching me the whole lesson as i was slow and really bad
 who's been more of a friend than anyone to me
 so for all i know no one is fixing it
i have to admit it feels a bit weird
 i can't do amy work anymore but i feel like i can't tell anyone because they would just dismiss it as being lazy
i turned on my computer and the sun came up
 i asked him if i could get a scan
 make excuses
 i feel no fear
  and it turns out my hearing was a lot better than i knew
 but i thought with my therapist i would be safe enough to speak the whole truth
 i send some texts frequently over the last couple of weeks
 i am alone
 "i'm worthless
 and in january and february i was mostly not thinking about it anymore even though i was still feeling terrible
 jobless and depressed
i am not really expecting anyone to explain this to me - apparently i am far too fucking stupid to understand if you try
 no way i am canceling that
walking back home the school where i was severely bullied for 8 years and sexually abused was in full view
 i called the manufacturer and tried to explain what happens
 i can't handle life
sa-chan
i was told to focus on doing things i like
the dog loves to go to the field next to mum's house
 but tonight
 this is the second thread i started
 i live with dishes cluttering my tiny kitchen that has no space already because washing the dishes hurts me especially
 memories are starting to come back
 i have nowhere else to go
 *sigh*
 my anxiety has been severe of late
i want to beat the shit out of her when she touches me without my consent
that i barely know
 i was a robot
 it's still wrong
i am a pathetic waste of space
 she just talks about how god will help me or whatever
i think of you daily even though we do not talk anymore
i am so confused right now
 writing
i don't know why i do it
 i don't need vision to know where the peach wine is in my cabinet
 if i'm not telling them
 not sure if it's from my dream last night or because my youngest kept me up most of the night or something else
  i don't know what to think
 pretty much any and all social situations scare the hell out of me
i am starting to suspect i have some degree of ptsd
 i don't work so that's out
 this is due to too many ear infections and various procedures to cure them too
 i am not sure if i want to die or just be numb
 and it makes sense she wanted to show off a little online
 when we talk on the webcam i have to get up and stretch a lot
 i keep trying to not eat and drink
 but the more i try the more upset i get that i'm not moving forward fast enough
 (untreated scoliosis)
 and now i woke up at 4 in the morning feeling numb
 i know they see it
 we stayed close (although i felt reluctant to tell her about depression and suicidal feelings like i did before
i'm sorry
"  i think some people take that to heart
  i tend to go a bit overboard in playing other games that mathematically i know i can't win at
and then the next morning i woke up in a normal mood again
so what does she tell me to do
on a plus i lost 4stone in weight
 emotionally irrelevant
 instead of me always harassing people
so first about my currently greatest problem: i am completely overworked
 one to the train company and another to the kiosk
feeling very ashamed
 medikinet
 male voice on the other side of the phone
 and that i need some assistance in dealing with this because i'm not able to handle it the usual way
 a big pile of nothing
my mom told me i never do anything
sorry for the caps lock
i have to plan my activities every day
 which seem so trivial in comparison to mine
 which i guess is good
 i barely get any sleep nowadays
 i always end up with just another "friend"
 opened my laptop and wrote two complaints
 that they don't want me around
 this would be an understandable assumption to make
 i know the only thing i would be interested in is talk therapy
 there's nothing they can even do to help anyway
 although i hate the idea of me living no more would the world stop turning
 but he didn't do more
 i feel tortured
 nothing works
 i get a call
 its a fixation right now
 it would never get done because she never does any of it
 my suicidal thoughts and hopeless pondering had already consumed me
  tonight i came to the conclusion that i should not be alive
 and he ran past
 what is it about this cycle that appeals to me
 i used to think of suicide only a couple times a month
 but it has stuck with me
 i was kicked out of my home and i've been living with my friend since
 and i wanted her to know about it
 and the pain isn't just over once i leave the stairs
 he's going to leave you"
 hopeless
 i'm hoping that i'm not alone here
 with all these mixed feelings and emotions
 ugh
 when i look in the mirror i see an empty husk who is nothing
 he brought me nothing
 like driving her to places she needed to go
when i was planning my move to san francisco
 and i know it was a joke but he ran away so fast and so far when i looked he was no where in sight
i take comcerta for attention deficit disorder
 but who instead has turned into a sociopath and narcissist
 which was both a relief and very hard and sad
10 weeks pregnant today
 if only there were a timeline on this pain
 again explained that i'm totally blind
i'll just shut up now as i could go on and on
 next
 i wish i could start all over
 i can only distract myself from my own suicidal ideations by throwing myself into helping others with resumes and job searches
 how about motivated to wake up
 (she is in a wheelchair) so i apologyzed but still dont understand what i did wrong
 things i don't want to think about
my grandfather was a musician
 it never ends
sorry in advance
 which in turn hurts in itself
suns out
 no more
that's as much as i write for now and i hope it is enough
 but
 which means
so what does she tell me
 nothing happened
 im ready to have a breakdown just from fighting sleep all day long
 we're both getting frustrated
i am seriously so fed up with myself
 i wish i could find hope
i went into a crisis center on friday afternoon and spent two hours talking to a therapist
 and it's not like i can talk to her about these things
life has been hard and i find myself wishing i was dead
so lately especially i've been taking extreme and quite sudden turns for the worst
 it feels like even in your own death you manage to fail
  everything towards the end of the day was crashing down on me emotionally
 bitch
 i have no friends
 i don't know what to do
 but the last hour can get so painful i only let 5 pass
 about a month ago i started noticing it was harder to focus
 she did lie and she did dump me
my past and present are catching up with me even in my nightmares
 and the last two days i have cried every ten minutes
 have nothing to lose
 fuming and hurting
 wrong hairstyle
  my life seems meaningless 
 the truth was that i had been eating plenty
 trying not to hurt myself over going back to school
 i feel like i just annoy everyone
 this is now the second time that the police have brought me in
  dark depression and anxiety to the point i don't want to leave the house and can't get anything done
 i remember being friendless
 i'm obsessed with watching tragic and depressing videos
 lost friends
 i'm worrying over things that are ridiculous to worry about
 i was pretty weirded out
 i wasn't going anywhere if my body and mind was simultaneously making me feel dreadful
watching tv
 my life is kind of disappointing
 maybe i'm just too lazy
 and thats all i want
anyway
 that i'm gay doesn't make it any more likely for me to actually find someone
 adding to my chronic pain
 i would like to start again
 but she didn't listen to my requests
 this pink huge crayola crayon holder thing 
 or until my parents kick me out then i'll go waste away on the street
 it worries me though
 i've since had another flare up of tonsillitis which did resolve itself
 if i can't realize i've got flu
 i've been thinking so much about telling my family i need help
 i feel like they are the only ones that listen
  i'm drained
 i don't go out (except to the casino
 and because i am still thinner than average
 so i would like to maybe try to fix that
  i would like to get down to around 222 lbs
 i try to do things like draw and i hope to get back to crocheting and maybe even painting
 as he had tried a few times before
 because he had lost another friend through suicide several years ago
i feel hopeless
i have to deduce that i'm just not a good person
 he put what i like to call a deadly idea into my head
i apologize in advance if this is the wrong section for this
 even though it's more than just your casual tired feeling
i just hate that i allowed that to happen
 it never really bothered me to the point of taking action
i am wondering
 not once in my life have i shunned a certain body type
 waiting around
 or when they try to hit on me even though i show that i am not interested or when they act bitter and hostile when i dont say ok to them
 and on the paper my mental condition is not bad enough either
 and although she knew i was really shy and i struggled a bit (because i had only just joined top set this year) she left me until last and i couldn't give a fact
 it feels like people are constantly putting down every aspect about me
 and i did this a couple times
 my head takes over me
  i don't know
 i find a solution
 stuck and alone that they're suddenly coming back full force and i just wish i would have ended everything last year as planned
 i don't need to add drama to my life anymore
 all that ever does is hurt me deeply
 and yet i am still thin
 it won't matter to anyone
 despite the pain
 i was seeing a counselor
  i dont know how i was condesending
 she told me i was condesensing and didnt even bother to knowor ask her how she was going to do things on her own
slowly killing me from the inside
 my aunt is constantly negative about anything and anyone while she just sits on her bum
 a criminal (and that's just my mother
 despite the fact that i am the healthiest i have ever been
another day
i dont know why my roommate and neighbor have been angry and snapping at me lately
 but i got a bright idea
 and complains all the time about henry being in the way
 can i not escape
  i have several things i do where i can make some â€œfound moneyâ€ù
 something happened to me a couple of nights ago and it's really stuck with me ever since
 was trying to get stuff accomplished today and not going well at all
 my doctor says i have generalized anxiety
and i took the dog for a walk
 even if it were just my family to feel the pain would whatever family i have whereever down the line not feel the pain
 but a crisis this isn't
 no one would notice or care anyway
i got my laundry done
 and i undid all that today
  ever since this happened i have been really depressed and i feel like i have lost everything
 i can't see
 started whispering my name
 cannot control my thoughts and feelings
 and was waiting on dbt
 it feels like my life is slipping away and i have no idea how to stop it
 i generally only seldom think of actual methods
 i just sunk back into my seat
 i didn't sleep for days
 there's little chance i ever will be
i dont even want to leave the home some days because i dont want to see some males' disgusting faces and stares
  i told him i had trouble believing him
 i thought i would outgrow this as a teenager
 it doesn't seem like a big deal
the kind of stupid that reduces me to tears of frustration and self loathing is the "how can you not fucking get this
when my pains got really bad a couple of years ago i didn't want to get on pain relief
i do not want to commit suicide but life is beginning to seem progressively more and more pointless and i fear my already lacking willpower will not be enough to prevent me from acting out of impulse
 texted her today and asked how she was
 truth be told i was wondering if i could get on disability benefits
 since it explains so much about me
 i can't even walk out the door to go buy paper towels and dish soap
 trying not to let the eating disorder take over for the baby's health
 i just don't know what to think about all of this
and we stopped coming
because i dont know if he can do anything
 my only friends are audrey and shannon
i worry a whole lot about possible upcoming emergency vet bills
 i sometimes get afraid of the 'monster' under the bed grabbing my legs
 saying he wants to visit and the end of the month (he lives over the other side of australia) he has visited me once here and i did not let him come or see my home i meet him out at public places
  my parents received a phone call at approximately 11pm
 i've tried to be strong all my life
 my husband can handle it when he gets home
 i only eat the ones from the butchers"
 i get up because i instantly know what it is
i am already nearly deaf on one ear
 at this point
 i had only had 5 hours of sleep (well 'only' is relative when some nights i only get 2 or less)
 i just want to puke on their faces
 i cant
 but the fact is i'd still hurt if i was skinny)
 well how can i hold a full time job in this condition
 i just feel truly lonely
 i'll see the same thing then that i do now
 i can barely complete the simplest of tasks without having worrying or crying
  i know that they exist
 i let it slide
why did i ruin a perfectly good thing
 then because i was sitting next to him they started picking on me too
but i'm starting to think i still have it
 this was all happening while her other friend was studying for exams
 because i began to not care whether i took them or not
 even though i am past middle age already
those arent accidental touchs
 researching
 so i went to sleep right away
 i can not even get out of bed
 i have another sore under my tongue and another on the inside of my lip
 but yea
 too tired to even question it inwardly
she was too good
 i have recently crashed hard
  i'm panicked i wont be good enough to look after her i'm panicked somthing will go wrong that she will get hurt and it will be my falut
 i need to talk to someone before i lose it
 for my own sake too
 i spend hours debating if i should post or not
 again
 and going to the grocery store
 granted
how crazy am i
 and for months all i could do was lie in bed and sob
 had my hormones tested
 my daily routine
 turns out the only way you can get that is having a mental illness
 i feel like depression doesn't necessarily perpetuate my life--it hastens it
fuckkkkkkkk
 look i made a suicide pun
 do i sound suicidal
 but my curiosity is never satisfied
 really cruel cos i thought any advice on this site would be proper medical advice on how to die in the best way possible with no pain
 i'm always sucking in my stomach trying to be skinnier and trying not to jiggle
 i seem to naturally put them in the most awkward positions ever
 or sensitive
 i'm so sad
it does feel weird to focus on me rather than finding work (to be perfectly honest i would rather live off of writing or something similar from home rather than having to work)
 i can't imagine why i put up with it
 i'm afraid i'll never change
 this happened the next day as well
 etc
tired of feeling lost and alone
 and i completely understand
 i am feeling so awful it was not me too
 i know it'll pass
i have gotten to the point where i no longer care about school
 i feel so wretched about it
i hate talking to males because they say stuff like men are smarter than women or women gossip but men dont or womem should look after a family
 please give us a call back when this happens again so you can verify for us what you see on the screen
i can't really wrap my head around this
this has been an infuriating topic for me for a long time
i'll admit it
and slowly i clawed myself back to life from a zombie like state
 where every few days
but meh
 i could talk to my family
 well i messaged her later in the evening to ask how the canning went
 but it honestly doesn't change the fact that i always end up developing feelings for someone who in my eyes showed me a bit more attention than the average joe
 i weigh a bit too much
 one of my references said that she would hate to lose me but understands why i need to leave
 i told him that not wanting to touch me or wanting me to touch him is painful
 fighting to get my clients what they are owed and need to survive is getting so much harder
 i fear the pain that it will take to reach it
"i mean
 until she broke that all down with just a few words and looks
so i need to figgure out a plan as to why i won't be able to have this vist or why i'll be busy
 and the people in my therapy group were really judgemental
 that's my fault too
 i left her alone for a week once
 but kept telling me i was always welcome to get back in touch
 but i've accepted it happened
 but i only speak the truth
she does so not get it and i don't really know how to make her understand
 blood clots in the lung
 why is it never anyone elses fault
that's not the full truth
 i'm scared to be alone for too long as i feel like everyone is staring at me
now i know it's stupid to start a relationship or anything like that in my current situation since it could only go wrong
 she tells me that she went into the department's dirty laundry
 my mum's dog ran from me towards them
 my family/ acquaintance/ culture isn't even religious so it's not as though they're working within a moral framework that accepts adherence to this type of rule
 i really need to be strong and just let him go
there are things that needs to be done
  i told her if she started to write an m1 hold i would leave at the start of our session
 i feel like i should've just killed myself before i was kicked out
avoid
 i feel like i got completely lost in all this
 that's a problem
 and people respond with "pic or it didn't happen
  occasionally pig out and end up throwing up but i'm slowly getting there
 panic instead of letting me talk
 i've had this ambition to at least pointlessly make it past another birthday
 i just wish i could be skinny
 and i was so worried i had become pregnant
 i don't want people to need me and i don't want to need others either
  it's a free shot at money so with no risk its positive expectation
 i want these thoughts to stop
that's is better of dead
 although it's much worse than before i just don't care at all anymore
 morning always seems to be the worst
 i'm scared to be firm with her and don't know how to do it properly(with her) she is not a difficult child at all she is quiet good but i'm just scared
 they're really close-minded in general) so i can't even get myself to tell them i have it
 fatigue
 don't give people hope when there is none
 it was not a method in how to end your suffering
 well anyone coming on this site knows only too well what makes people want to die
 he shows lots of anger to me
 i wouldn't date/befriend/touch me so i don't expect anyone else to either
 i contacted my counselor
 he's also mentioned his foot fetish and how he wants pictures of my feet for the express reason of masturbation
 why is it hugely shocking to insult an overweight girl
 it's just a better game than slots as far as payout over time is concerned
 i said i dont know
im not even upset at my life at this point
i'm struggling and i really just need to vent
 technically it's just bricks and mortar now
 i worried it was pcos
 dare i say it was kind of cute
 how betrayed they must feel
 i already get set off by things that remind me of him and i don't want anymore
  this whole thing seems very self-absorbed to me
primarily because it was the last song my grandfather sang to me before he died
 and sometimes i'd take a few more slices so i had for the next meal next to my bed as well
 i guess i'm ok with only having 2 or 3 friends from high school but as stupid it would be with my current life circumstances i still wished i had a boyfriend
the irony of  all this is that we lost a family friend to suicide a few years ago
i flat out told the professionals that if you started writing those holds i would leave
 i tried going back to sleep
if only i can disappear
i don't even cry anymore
 still trying hard but am managing
im just tired
 but i kept forgetting to do refill
 but the thoughts are there
 i mean desperate to die
 but i get the feeling that no matter how close i get she'll still have trouble finding time to see me
 completely void
 caffiene does nothing anymore
 going through terrible things
 i can't control myself
 i guess i'll be a scrooge my whole life
 i mean yeah im safe and all but its kind of wishing i wasnt
 she also got mad at me for not knowing how to drive
 having to always work and never being able to catch up or earn enough stability to have children
 but fear gripped me again
 i sometimes get sad
  things needing to be done and i feel useless
 one way or another we are all headed there eventually
 i just wonder why it's like this
 but who knows who i'll be when i've been helped
 then dropping out of school as a result of lack of motivation
 and when i'm sick that balance gets even worse
i just put my best friend to sleep not even 12 hours has passed
imagine after you feel everything is going to be okay now
 in reality
 i think i may die soon anyways
 i just turned 64 and wish it were over
 my former/ lost friend began practicing yoga regularly
 that in particular made me feel even more helpless
like wtf
 â€œi am sorry due to funding cuts you are on your own
 i just need to pig out on some ice cream and chocolate
 and i had been trying to talk her out of it
 but it couldn't have been more than a few days
  it can feel like it won't end
 i knew what it was before they told me
 i feel like this endless battle should really be ending soon
 i don't see a way out of this hell
 i just needed to get this out somewhere 
 most are either only there to actually study or they are with friends they already know
  she was angry that i had talked my way out holds in mid-march
i did things to avoid arguments from happening
 already want the baby to be here but mostly to go back to restricting
 but it's not anything serious
 and he agrees to circle the charges for me and handle it personally
making bad decisions and having this repeating cycle
 i feel nobody could care about me at all unless i can benefit or help them its the only time people contact me
 i don't do anything because i don't know what to do
