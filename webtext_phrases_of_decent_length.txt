 i really need to listen to more rap
dude
 you don't need to listen; you need to live it
i didn't want to listen to my dad explain sex to my mom
why would your dad explain sex to your mom
because my brother asked what the song
 "come my lady
 come
 come my lady" meant
 and mom didn't know
what does that song have to do with sex
you don't 
 you're the only person in the world who doesn't know
your brother didn't know
my brother is 7
yeah
 that's the first thing i learned when i moved here: don't eat street meat
 it's probably pigeon or something
yeah
 i wish i could get my husband to stop eating it
i don't care what kind of meat it is as long as it's in my mouth
that's my sister; she's looking for a hook-up
 i'm not
i'm married
that cap belongs on your head
it on my head
yeah
 i ran away once
 'cause like
 my parents were making me study for a science test

not having money to buy food is a 
 not having an is a problem

 i just dumped her
 can i buy you two a drink
do you guys sell bling
all the way in the back
 under the skeleton pimp
i'm like your gay boyfriend
kind of
only without the gay sex part
 of course
 and without the sense of style
i don't know if i'd say that
 you're just very emotional
 but you should really work on the style
 'cause it's the best thing about the gay
move
 motherfuckers
 move 
wait for the next one
 this is too packed
bitch
 i have to be on this train
this isn't the train to heaven

you 18
well
 i'm actually 22
girly
 you look like you are 10
but it's okay
 i like that
yeah
 the subway runs express out of astoria and local into astoria
 it wouldn't make sense any other way
 see all the people on the train
why would it only run express one way
you're not from here
 i don't expect you to understand
you wanna hear something
 like
 totally outrageous
always
one side of my hair grows faster than the other
no way
 that's weird
yeah
 like
 the right side grows faster than the left side
 and i have to show up at a salon and have them cut off the right side but not the left
you're weird
i keep getting screwed over on my haircuts
 last time they left it way too shaggy in the back
 and this time it's much too short
 i need to find a stylist i can stick with
 so your hair is like shlong or something
shlong
 like short-long
 shlong
 well
 "shlong" means "penis" in yiddish
 i didn't know that
i sure hope i don't have a penis growing out the back of my head
so my brother's bar mitzvah is this saturday and he asked me to cut off my hawk for it so i cut it off
 but on sunday i am going to dye it black with orange tips

 what kind of person marches their daughter into their sixth grade class and announces that their daughter just ate a whole chicken
 who does that
 i never forgave her for that
if i ever become a cannibal
 now i'll know what cuts of meat to ask for
i had a turkey injected with pomegranate juice once
 it was very delicious
yeah
 if i'm really hungry it doesn't matter about morals anymore
 i'll just dive right into bacon
 anything
 forget about the vegan thing
 so for god's sake don't ever leave me alone with bacon
 or human
so i actually tried garlic knots one day when i wasn't high and i was like
 "wow
 these good
and there's really garlic on them
 too
i'm hungry
 not hungry like i want to eat
 but hungry
when i was young
 my mother used to make so much carbonated food
 can i have a pizza with no cheese
this day is going by fucking slow; it's only 1:30pm
my eye is going to fall out
 so what do you want for dinner again
attention all units
 attention all units
does anyone want chinese food
 i work at mcdonalds; they spit in all your food
 i swear to god
don't get too close to paul because if he busts ass it's going to smell like y2k
please do not disturb the canine dogs
we used to have a bunny just like that one
 then we had to take it to the liquor store
my dog tail is too long
 i wanna cut it off
i just got a friendster request from a dog
everyone has a fucking pit bull
it's like everyone on myspace suddenly got a pit bull
you know
 now that i don't have a girlfriend
 i should get a dog
 isn't that how it works
she was happier than a pig having 50 orgasms
so we were talking about how warm it was out
 so he says
 "that stupid fucking groundhog is always wrong
 and i says
 "you stupid fucking bastard
 that ain't 'til february
you're like a hamster in bed
watch it
 mister 
 i've got two dogs here
 animals can't see you know
come on
 follow me
follow me
 i'm riding into the future
you are requested to be at your gate for your non-stop flight to jfk
 new york
red fist
 can't go
quit fucking around on the sidewalk
next guest with 10 items or less
 step down
 not ten and a half
 ten
gangstas coming out
 what the fuck is that
let's face it
 i'm pretty fabulous; i don't need you to come down
i know
 $100 for pills that aren't even for something that important
it's not like they're aids pills
he says it's better
 but i just say it's cheaper
it's insane
 eighty percent of twenty-five
 take thirty off of that
 dude
 i'm looking at houses
 i mean
 fuck it
you tell her that i'll lower it down to $50 for her
 and you can assure her
 she'll be satisfied at least 3 times
you just spent $200 on dinner and you can't spend $2 on a metrocard
yeah
 so i was talking to the guys about getting a pull-out couch so i could stay over
 but then max said i would have to give sexual favors for money if i wanted to stay there
excuse me
 are you selling freud by any chance
the fuckin' r train is a motherfuckin' myth
 i swear to god
 it's the fuckin' unicorn: only fools and virgins can see it
i wish i had a shyster lawyer
 you know
 it's my fantasy in life just to be left alone
i hope the new xbox has a vagina
i really cried
 i thought wrestling was real
"close my eyes and think of england
" in all my born days
 i never thought someone would ever say that to me
then
 i met you
i wanna like move to a faraway island with a mute sex slave and lots of indigenous pot
that's all i really need because i can talk to them and they can hear
but they can't respond
and they'll just express themselves through sex
like when they're mad it will get rough
and when they arent mad it will be gentle like the motherfucking ocean
so you're taping 4 to 5 people in a row
 that's great
if hitler were still alive and he were gay you would have thought he'd decorated that apartment
 it was a soulless aesthetic abomination
yeah
 me neither; if you are ugly you at least have to be nice
i saw a woman with half a head
 literally half a head
 she had this indentation in her left hemisphere where they had taken out her skull to remove her brain
 i almost barfed
 but i didn't
c'mon honey
 i'll draw your picture
 make you look like chewbacca
shit
 man
 i can't do it
shit man
 nigga look like mumm-ra from the thundercats
carson daly looks like a colostomy bag
with cocoa butter on it
and every time she'd yell at me for something i just wanted to be like
 "shut up
 you're ugly
you know when you look at someone and you can just tell they're a douchebag
 like they have a douchebag face
 yeah
 i hate people like that
i got guys asking me to send them pictures of my cooter
 it's like guys know when you're taken; they flock to you like bees to moldy bread
you know who's got it tough
 those girls in africa getting there clits cut off
i mean sometimes i can't afford a cup of coffee but at least i still have my clit
i that woman
 man
 i worship the ground between her legs
well
 i'm not going to eat just anyone's pussy
 but i'm going to with strangers
i just described my pussy as "vagically delicious
" and i wanted to leave you a message because i thought you would appreciate that
 that felt like vaginal secretion
just tell him you have genital sores
i'm pmsing
 so like
 don't take it personally
omigod dude
 the main detective guy from law & order: svu guest stars as a pediatrician on 
 i could never imagine him doing the things he's doing right now
no dude
 omigod
 you know he was on and he was a gay prisoner and he liked getting it in the ass and giving it too
 that's extreme
 man
but wait
 is english a race
holy shit
 that's going on overheard tomorrow
hey girl
 i really like your red hair

 i'm not hitchhiking
 i'm fucking paying you
 and if i tell you to turn around you damn well better turn around

and it won't stop growing
i think you need a doctor
oh yeah

 "hey doc

 yeah
 right
maybe you shouldn't say that out loud
there's no way i could get that guy
 he is absolutely gorgeous
what do you think you are
 an omelette
no honey
 that's the litterbox
 that's where the
what language are they singing in
 is that german
 it's european
well
 i do want people cloning me
 unless god came to me in a dream and said
 "pilar
 you need to clone yourself so that you can live again and save the world"
 then i will
 but otherwise
 i do want people cloning me
 because if you get cloned you know you have to relive all your same problems and stuff
 isn't that how cloning works
 anyways
 cloning is stupid
yeah
 cloning is stupid
 why haven't they been working on a cure for aids or breast cancer
 they just want to make everyone die so they can clone them
 that horse is peeing
dude
that is a of pee
what
 you want to push me out the window
i would
 but unfortunately you won't fit
bastard
has anyone in this room been convicted of a felony
 come up to the front desk
okay
 i'm going to go up there
 i'm all done
 i told you you should've murdered someone
 you'd be out too
we can't have sex until we get married
sex is a form of marriage
but we're not ready to get married
your mom
fucking shit
 man
 this bitch is kicking our asses
you just used four different curse words in one sentence 
so this is the man you want to marry
yeah
and you said there were many maggots on the turkey
my dog is so racist
 she is scared of black people
 but she also hates the black people of dogs
what does that even mean
pugs
 can you spare 20 cents
okay
 30 cents
40 cents
50 cents
 but that's my final offer
can you spare a hundred bucks
a hundred bucks
what the hell am i going to do with a quarter
y'know what i'd do if i was rich
what
buy a big mac
but you already have a big mac
 this is all theatrical
 i only have a dollar
can you spare some change
got any spare change
well
 i take dollars too
 give me your phone
 we can discuss it later
can you spare some money
 sorry
 i don't have any change
that's okay
 i take dollar bills
 too
 no credit cards or checks
so i was making a roast
 but the thing was that i only had chicken stock gravy
 chicken stock gravy
 so i it
 on the beef
you live on the edge
 mom
our biggest problem with sex was that he came too fast
 because he was so into me
 so now he uses desensitizing condoms
 and that works a lot better
 especially because it takes me a really long time to have an orgasm with him
i was really anxious
 so i went to my gp and she prescribed klonopin
 that completely took my anxiety away
 but then my doctor said that she didn't feel that that was a good long-term drug
 i guess i agree with that
 i did take one klonopin on the plane yesterday
 but that was okay because it was just a recreational klonopin
now that i'm a wife i thought i should be more proper
 but it turns out he likes me slutty
i think the most passionate sex i will ever have will be during some really passionate adulterous affair
 i would have to make a really conscious decision not to have an affair; it would be like fourth-order cognition
wait
 so you're on law & order 
mm-hmm
 i don't watch the show
 but my son and daughter do
 what's your name
 i'll have to tell them i saw you
epatha
epala
epatha
epasa
ensala
 maybe i should write this down
 i'm sure i'll forget
 emana
 you said
if i had a dollar for every time i saw her blowing a guy
you'd have a lot of dollars

so you're still writing songs and performing
uh huh
and you're also acting
 right
 and modeling too
yeah
which would you say you're most passionate about
i guess i'd have to say the modeling
you've had the greatest sex with me
 right
yeah
 i guess
i'm tellin' ya
 if a girl's bathroom is dirty
 that means that
well
 i have a clean bathroom
well
 i'd be surprised if you said you have a dirty bathroom
you dropped your glove
 sir

mommy

jesus is the answer
 come to jesus and he'll hold you in his arms
 come home to jesus
by the way
 just so you know
 the rest of us all think you're fucking nuts 
you know what's really gross
 seeing the rats that get run over by the subway cars
 they're all split open and stuff
this one time i saw a rat get washed up on the shore
 he was missing all his skin
did he look happy
yo dude
 block the door with your foot for a minute
go down those stairs over there
 and the track is on your left
where
down those stairs
 on your left
thank you
 i wish i had your job
you couldn't handle my job
you got more teeth than me
yeah
 i got six
 but three of them are broken
you got six and a half
 i need to go to nutley
 new jersey
 i know that the 192 bus goes
 but--
don't make yourself too comfortable
 just ask
do you all have a financial planner
 i think it's very important
i didn't go to harvard business school just to let some guy from cornell manage my money
i hate taking subways
 they're so gross
i know
 so many dirty
 smelly people
 and it's so expensive
yeah
 $2 is a lot of money
yeah
 well
 if you can find someone else to cart your ass around this city for $2
 be my guest
i have the best blind date story ever
oh yeah
my sister's friend flew from australia to la for a blind date
 and she ended up flying to aruba with the guy and marrying him like a week later
 that's awesome
but i think she was just
 like
 35 and desperate to get married
you can't do that
 this is a passenger train
the blood of jesus christ
 you can't do that; this is a passenger train
 you need to find jesus
that is the devil's drink
 by the blood of jesus you need to repent
lady
 i am the devil
you can't do that on a passenger train
 if i see a police i will have you arrested
you wanna borrow my cell phone
i just geeked out my profile by a million percent
 what do you think
hold up
 let me check
so what do you think
yeah
 that evangelion child shit is weird
like how weird
do you have any matches
can i see id
you need id for matches
 for just matches
i can't give you matches without id
id for matches
what the fuck is this world coming to
"you've got cigarettes
 but you don't have matches
 that don't make sense
" we sell lighters
 stupidass
 buy one
shit
 i ain't paying for peak hours
i can hide in the bathroom
or you can flash him
so my mom is all depressed because of the hurricane katrina stuff
 and she says she has no time to take care of herself
 and i say
 "it's just a call to duty
 mom
" i mean
 if she'd go to the beauty parlor
the beauty parlor probably got destroyed
 and they had to build a new one
 and i say
 if she just goes in there and has them
fix her hair
 or something
she'll feel so much better
hey honey
 slow down
 my feet hurt and i'm cold
why don't you shut the fuck up and walk
 i want to go the fuck home
 bitch
sweeney todd 
i heard that's a spoof on a cooking show
 is it about julia child
i think so
 my professor started talking about the diary of anne frank 
 anne frank
 i used to love her
 i had the diary
 the notebooks and the pencils and everything
i think she means lisa frank
did you bring your book
yeah
oh good; that way we don't have to talk
he's crazy
 see
 when you say "crazy" i'm thinkin' 
 like smashing-car-windows crazy
i know he's crazy
right
 so you should be able to be like
 "he's crazy"
 and
but i'm used to his level of craziness
 the spelling bee--
was one of the kids indian
yeah
 there was an indian kid and a white kid
so typical
 my parents entered me in a spelling bee and i was fucking horrible
 anyway
 there were those two kids and i just wanted to throw playstations at them and yell
 "i'm setting you free
 i'm setting you free
excuse me
 where does this train go to
florida
florida
 texas
 california
okay
 good
you ever just have one of those days 
yeah
i'm having a whole week
 i swear to god
 and i just walked here from
 forget it
and now i can't even find my makeup
 i swear to god
 if they don't have it
 i'm gonna fucking
i don't know
i'll fucking kill a tourist
 i hope it's not me
that's her
 that's her
 that's the new yorker who cursed at me and threatened me
it's like seeing one in their natural habitat
 i can't wait to tell everyone a new yorker threatened you
i know
 it's awesome
it's so cool that we get to ride the train all day for free
yeah
 i guess so
we should just ride it all day to like
 take advantage
 oh my god
 that's so jewish
you know why guys don't like mushrooms
who said guys don't like mushrooms
because they taste like cum
i bought my dad a clint eastwood biography for christmas
 i feel like that's a pretty solid bet for any dad
 clint
 frank sinatra
 maybe brando
what about james dean
yeah
 i guess
 what about that vin diesel
you are seriously obsessed
 dude
don't hate on the diesel
 ooh
 you know who everyone loves
 that anne frank
anne frank was a lesbo
i couldn't not buy it
yeah
 i'm thinking about it too
 it's totally worth it
i mean
 there are two real porn stars in it
 if it was just one
 i could have passed it up
yeah
 man
 but for that price
 you almost have to do it
 for instance
 if somebody killed your mother and you killed theirs to get back at him--
don't even such a thing
 you're talking to fucking oedipus here
the color of the car is not burgundy; it's purple
 i think it's burgundy
 it's purple
 i should know what purple is
 i used to have purple hair
you had purple hair
when did you have purple hair
oh my god
 my hair is so dark
does it look fake
 i just didn't know it would be this dark
well
 it will look lighter when your hair dries
marilyn monroe is
 like
 one of my idols
wait
 isn't he that guy with the glass eye
honey
 we don't have to see memoirs of a geisha 
 you lived it
 didn't you
you just know the right things to say
some people make me wish that snow outside was really acid
 my cousin is going to be on american idol 
 she any good
 she's terrible
 she sounds like a dying seal
where did you hear that
 what news have been watching
canadian
you would like him 'cause he looks like a gorilla
 and they are from the amazon like you
dummy
 gorillas are from africa; you of all people
i wish it would snow so i could make a kate moss joke
if you start to get blown away
 just drop the umbrella
the sun is nice today
i really liked the wind on that block
 it was bearable
 mother nature's a bitch
 and she just gave you a blowjob
my husband has this hierarchy of terrible things that can happen to a person
 and you wanna know what tops off his list
 according to him
 the number one most horrible thing that can ever happen to a person is getting snow on your wrists
she came to me and said
 "we the people of the 15th floor have decided that you are not friendly
" and i said
 "that's not in the lease
don't ever give up your dreams
 this is new york
 it's not even about the numbers
 i've come too far to give up my dreams
 don't give up your dreams
so canal street is this way
now this is the new york
 this is the new york you see on tv
new york is the best country in the world
you go to chelsea and it's like glory hole city
stop turning it
 it could fall over on you
 and it's got points
you guys live in a very silly place
 brooklyn
 that's silly
 everyone left with the dodgers
 dad
 yeah

this is
 like
 intellectual popcorn
 hey
 girl in the red shirt
prettiest girl on the whole train
a:d look at this- she can read
 too
this is just bullshit
 or whatever the hebrew for "bullshit" is
dinosaurs are so stupid
have you ever tried to talk about thesis statements to people who have their fingers up their noses
 it works out
 you like girls who are as smart as you are
 he likes girls who are smarter than he is
 and likes girls who are
 well
 dumber than he is
i definitely liked picasso more when he was freaking out
i be readin' that shakespeare shit
 he talkin' 'bout some "epoxy dat wench"
 and "wherefore to thou
you can't touch me
 i know my rights
 i'm an educated criminal; i'm your worstest nightmare
i'll have to call you back from a landline
 can you give me the number
 uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
you know what
 i don't have a pen to write this down
 does it spell anything
oh baby
 you shoulda woke me up
we coulda done the do again
but i really want chase
i guess i'll have to call him back and tell him to put it in my butt
i should call her
 she's probably taking off her pants right now
you know
 for a vegetarian you sure have a lot of man meat
and what is wrong with having a threesome with an asian 
the food came
 and then so did i
french girls will just come up to your apartment and get naked fast
i was pulling boys in closets six months ago to make out with them
 that's what happens to horny girls who don't get the kind of attention they need
well yes
 you call me back
 just not between the hours of 8 and 10pm
 why do you think
 it's jack bauer power hour
 times 2
 it's going to be motherfucking terrorist-kicking time
 that whispering bad ass mofo is going to be going on strong tonight for 2 hours
 praise 
 jacky should be the father of my children
 i will however totally call you directly after the show
so i said
 " i do not look like john lithgow 
i prefer musicals with singing in them
 man
 you don't understand
 i mean his tongue was so fucking far inside of her
that guy is a good actor
well
 if i put up a fat picture of me
i still wouldn't do anything about it
i had a few drags on new year's eve
 and woke up the next morning sounding like tara reid
i'm the oldest of all my siblings
 i feel like moesha
it's okay
 but i don't understand why he doesn't get caught
the phantom of the opera 
 are you kidding
 that cast is so white it makes you want to puke
 they are so lily white it makes me sick
i just don't get it
 like
 how can you be infatuated with me when you don't even know me
he won't marry her
 but they'll probably get engaged
i finally figured out why i take solace in so many other men
 they have been my refuge and it's because i love him so much
in all this time you've only had three things to talk about
 and they were all things that i told you
i woke up and i looked down and there were bite marks all over my boobs and i had a wicked bad hangover
 then i rolled over
 kissed the guy on the forehead
 and said
 "thanks for the orgasm" and then just left 'cause i was totally having my mattress delivered that day
my favorite part of the game is when i get to kill
 but you only get to kill other people in the wilderness
i'm in love with you and you say you gonna shoot me in the face
 what's up with that
lemme tell ya
 she gonna be alive by next christmas
that's a fact
not if i have anything to do with it
 what you lookin' at 
and it was just in time
 my wife was going to kill my father
 i mean just kill him
did you know if they found out who tried to blow up that starbucks
hello
yeah
 i'm at the movies
yeah
 i know
i'm in the fucking theater
i don't care if she needs brain surgery
 i'm at the movies
maybe i'm just not used to watches
 or maybe it cancer
so i had to go to the doctor to take care of my excessive earwax problem
here
 give this to your kid
 i'm sure he's into castration
 masturbation
 amputation
 and getting aids on purpose
you have to watch out for those pre-cancerous lesions
 you know
 those can lead to cancer
so how many mexicans trying to seduce you
these are nice
 but they just look like puerto rico
i speak better spanish after a shot of tequila
spanish niggas can't swim
 you ain't neva heard of no spanish jacques cousteau or nothin'
aw shit
 i guess l
 stands for "look
 everyone's spanish
mother
 that duvet situation is a nightmare
bitch
 that's my spot
 move your fag ass mercedes out of my spot
my kids aren't used to this; they're used to the hamptons
fine
 but she lives in the land of cheap and pretty jewelry
yeah
 i got $25; that looks big when it's all singles
a prince
 another prince
 princesses
 princesses

 now don't let these girls drink or smoke and get them home before midnight
it's gonna be sweet when i get that marvel comics check
 when i get that marvel comics check
 i'm gonna copy it so i can put it up on my wall
my baby's so low she can help me walk up steps
that's bullshit
 you know what i am saying
 i mean
 it's not my fault he signed the birth certificate
 wait
 you mean they ran out of fetuses
yeah man
 the doctor said she's only 36 weeks pregnant
 but the baby is at 40 weeks
 she could drop that thing right quick
when my son was born he was very hairy
 so i had terrible heartburn
 you're married
 you can't be doin' that shit
she was hot
 right
 pampers are intense
i heard on cnn today that this woman in france just received the first successful face transplant after she was mauled by her labrador
 they replaced like her whole nose and lips and chin or something
whoa
i know
i mean
 i thought labradors were
 like
 really friendly
don't pull my hair
i wasn't
 i was just holding on
to my hair
so he said
 "sex is a very beautiful thing
 you shouldn't be ashamed about it
sex is a beautiful thing
 your parents had sex
or you were adopted
 can you spare me something
like what
so i was watching vh1 and it was a show about child stars
 you know
 drew barrymore
 jodie foster--
what
 jodie foster was a child star
yeah
 she was a child prostitute at like
 and they made a movie about it and everything
lookit that chart
 they're ranking condoms
 see
 trojan magnum
 then regular trojans
 then trojan ultra sheer
 then durex regular
 then lifestyles
 and then lifestyle ultra-sensitive
 see
 trojan ultra sheers
 yeah
but durex has at least one more that should go in there
 durex has a magnum too and it's really good
so yeah
 what's their deal
like
 it' all about how well they endure
 not how much pleasure they give
 fucking government chart
anyway
 i'm definitely thinkin' about havin' my kids in a foreign country
 like
 dual citizenship
 just take a semester off
 fly to britain for a month
 and voila
that's the craziest thing i've ever heard
 what for
they just come out cooler
 that's all

 he almost sounds like the real deal
nigga can tell a dishonest nigga by how eloquent he is
 if a nigga ain't eloquent
 it means he don't know how to bullshit
 eloquent nigga knows how to bullshit
 which means he probably be lyin' all the time
 always trust a nigga who ain't eloquent
you can't be sounding smart like that
 girls ain't into niggas who talk smart and shit
 they into dumb niggas these days
 teen boy #2: i wonder why
i dunno
 maybe they just into their personality and
why all these niggas always callin' people niggas all the time

 the cell phone is a public nuisance
 the white man comes in with his technology and makes a mess of the world
 i don't wanna hear about your friend
 i don't wanna know your friend
 i don't wanna know you
 why do i got to hear about your friend
 and where you're gonna meet your friend
 let me tell you something
 white man done took over the world
 back in the days black man ruled the world and called his name pharaoh
fellas
 fellas
 keep up the good work
 seriously
 i love black people
 but here's what i'm trying to say
we're from africa
 the sun is our commodity
 the white man
 they from europe
 you can't farm in europe
 it's too cold
 so we them how to farm
 and what did they do
 they mastered that shit with machines
 you see what i'm trying to say
 the white man
 what he did is he compromised our manhood with that slavery shit
 you see what i'm trying to say
 i see more uncle toms every day than i do black
i'm gonna knock you motherfuckers out
 i'm fuckin' itching to knock a white motherfucker out
you know why we ain't git no respect
 bad marketing
what
i mean
 "we shall overcome"
 bitch
 slogan should have been "we shall kick yo ass 
" we'd be gettin some respect today
those fuckin' niggers
 i fuckin' swear it's always those fucking niggers
 they are the ones raping and killing our white little girls
 i fucking swear
 put a fucking white girl in the south bronx and you fuckin' see what the fuck they do to that girl's body
he just sucks so bad
all black people suck
yeah
 ghetto
 ghetto white
i don't wanna sit next to white people
white people
 you have nothing to be afraid of
 we are only three black men
 we cannot hurt all of you
i couldn't believe that shit
 black people are such stereotypas
 what an asshole
hey girls
you have to be careful
 i know what problem is
 it is all the black people
 just look at these black people
 look at the street
 all black 
 it just keeps getting worse
 more are coming
 i wanna make homemade caramel apples
they're called black people
who's that over there
that's yasser arafat
yasser arafat
 he sure is fat
kind of looks like dad the time he put that towel over his head
how much for a ride
45 dollars
this is the last time i'm going to tell you
 get off this street with this horse
 if i see you one more time on this street i'm taking the horse and i'm locking you up
 you hear me
 i'll take this horse and i'll lock you up
 fuckin' bitch
so how did your trial go
it went well
 it went my way
that's great
yeah
 the guy was actually nice; well
 he was listed as a violent felon
 but
a nice violent felon
yeah
 he tried to play the "my 88 year old dad and my wife and kids are here
 i'm in rehab trying to clean up my life" card
 but i put him on the stand for the whole day and caught him in all these lies
i can't believe she's in love with a guy who's 26
well
 my dad couldn't say anything if i went out with a guy who's 28 even
 'cause he married someone like 20 years younger than him
 is she a hottie
she's a lawyer
 so she can't be
so i used to buy my drugs from a guy who would keep them in his prosthetic leg
you mean his stump
 didn't that freak you out
 having his stump all on your blow
so how was it
it was bitchfabulous
awesome
 so it was bitchtastic
nice
 i like that one
 yeah
 it was bitchtastic
and the coffee
bitchalicious
 i just realized someone might hear us
i just pissed myself
 oh man
 i stink
 i pissed myself and i stink
i don't smell nothing
i'm fucked up
 man
not as screwed as me
 right
what do you mean
i can't figure out whose freaking hand is down my pants
i should have known you had that one
yeah
 i mean
 i have every barbra streisand recording ever
i shouldn't have gotten that for you; it was such a stupid gift
 i'll just sell the old one on ebay
fine
 fine
 i'll buy you a blt
 how 'bout that
a blt
 i'm jewish
 you idiot
 whatever
 i see you eat a blt every day
 liar
yeah
 i didn't know it was a true story
well
 i'm going to church tomorrow
say hi to jesus for me
 grandma
 you're not going
i stopped going when the priest stopped telling dirty jokes
i'm sure all of you have seen a photo of babe ruth and would be able to recognize him
 his autograph is worth almost as much as abraham lincoln's is
i don't know what a babe ruth is
 he's a famous baby
ma'am
 please step into the back of the store
but why
don't make this harder on yourself
but why
they do make it harder on themselves
 don't they
fuck you 
lord
 help me
 i don't know which way to turn
turn left
i can't even figure out how to get the fuck out of here
try the big ass door labeled "exit
okay
 what should i get
 the gombee burger sounds good
 hey
 that kinda sounds like gandhi
except he probably wouldn't want to eat the burger
 remember that time he was on that hunger strike
aren't cows like
 sacred to hindus or something
 that's probably why he wouldn't have wanted to eat it
my friends told me that you told them that i'd hijacked you
 we've only dated for a week
 for so many reasons it's not going to work out
i don't understand how someone can just say it's not going to work out
 you know everything about me: my family
 my life
 all about me
 i shared everything this week
 i would have held back if i'd known
it's like i have sticker shock
you are just a much more fun
 engaged person than me
i don't understand someone who can just say it's not going to work out
 how can you just say it's not going to work out
can't we be friends
 that's why i asked you to meet me here
well
 at least we slept together this week
 i never wait
 i'm so glad we didn't wait
terry
 what are those people doing
 is that fake blood
i think they're representing chinese torture or something
excuse me
 have you ever read the catcher in the rye 
do you know where the ducks go in the winter
 the ones in central park; do you know where they fly to
 yeah
 they just go to the duck house
they should have a test for eveyone coming out of high school to weed out the stupid kids from the gene pool
 if you don't pass
 you 
yeah
 like how momma hamsters eat their babies when they know they won't make it in the real world
 where you live
 son
up by the fat albert store
 man
oh yeah 
 son
 i used to live right near there
by the hospital
yeah
 man
 that's the hospital that i went to when i had the hepatitis
 son
 yo for real though
 that shit hurts
oh my god
 i was peeing so much
 it just kept coming
 so like i was like sitting there all last period peeing
oh my god
 you should go to a doctor

it was crazy
 i just kept peeing
the kid next to you is recording this on his cell phone
oh my god
 stop 
oh my god
 there's a spider in my salad
what
 that's not a spider
well
 it's either a spider or four pubic hairs tied together in a knot
 neither of which i am willing to consume
she once said to me
 "i was thinking about us kissing in the shower
i hope you were wearing clothes
does she even shower
that's what i asked him
 but then he said
 "not only does she shower
 but then she licks my ass and jacks me off
 it's fucking great
you smell great
thanks
 i haven't bathed since eleven
did you hear that the dude who shot the pope got let go from jail
yeah
 and the pope forgave him and everything
 i totally want to shoot the pope now
yeah
 he'd probably be cool with it
she's not a slave
slaves have a third grade reading level
fourth
"roosevelt island"
 is this the same as roosevelt avenue
i don't know
 maybe
let's try it
you don't want to get off here
 roosevelt avenue is later
thanks
 you know
 i hear new yorkers are mean but so far i've only met nice ones
we were in the middle of having sex
 and i was screaming
 like
 "oh god
 oh god
" he looked down at me and replied
 "there is no god
 i am your god
uh huh
it sucks because since then i haven't been able to sleep with atheists
 you're not an atheist

 barbara streisand

 annie: the musical 
 you said
 "best of all
" that's amazingly gay
she gave him an ipod
 can you believe it
 it's like
 just not cool for a to give a an ipod
 a guy can give a girl an ipod
 but it shouldn't happen the other way around
 it's just not right
we're going to 8th avenue
 right
to bergduff goodman's
 i bet you would usually be listening to your ipod on the subway instead of talking to a group of pretty women
i like
 never go above 14th street
 i stay within a five block radius of my apartment
i read about that store before
 maybe i'll buy some blang to go with my new bag

) that's all i remember from that night
 i woke up the next morning
 in bed
 soaking wet
 with a pulled groin muscle and scrapes all over my knees and elbows
what the fuck 
yeah
 i had to ask around to find out what happened
 apparently
 i sorta
 fell in the lake in madison--i pulled my groin muscle there--then i pulled myself out and crawled home on hands and knees since i couldn't walk
what
the fuck
since i quit
 i have been blowing out the biggest boogers in the mornings

 i bought him drugs
he'd get tenure
 otherwise

i keep waiting for them to come up with one named
like
"sextra
" for people who want extra sex

 cigars
 pipes
 marijuana
 crack
 or cocaine

 the movie 
 your dog looks like a gremlin

i don't want to visit my miserable family unless it's for a funeral
sorry it took me so long; i had to move
 that lady smelled
 like an old person
 she smelled like my grandmother right before she died
yeah
 i could never be a dead person
unless i was actually dead
 i guess
do not touch any of these people; they'll pull out a gun and shoot you
i'm not writing; i'm my memoirs
 and after i'm done with that
 i'll probably go and do something
 like
 kill my mother
 she deserves it
and then
 of course
 there was the human sacrifice
 yup
 human sacrifice with red bouncing balls
i'm not 
 i just want to make sure he doesn't kill you
one time when i was dance-walking
 i ran into a dead guy
they were all fighting over us
 who would get us if my parents died
 and my godparents won
he's just lucky you don't hire an assassin and take care of it
if he were alive and female and cool i'd go out with him
no one is gonna kill somebody for five dollars
you must've done some to get shot in church
and then my dad stabbed him
 and that's when it all went to shit
see this
 it's a true story
 that guy
 he died

 whenever she touches her hair she has to wash her hands
or make fried chicken
so did you pick london for question #7
yeah
 i think so
 i think i did really well
yeah
 me too
 i just hope we don't have to take the test again
why would we have to take it again
well
 if they get three or more lawsuits
 they have to give everybody the test again
but if they give it again
 won't we know the answers
 are you saying they give us the 8th grade test
 they give us the 7th grade test
so won't everyone know the answers
 i think they give us next year's 7th grade test
 so we wouldn't know the answers
this is not going to happen
 my mother taught me respect
 i know you understand that
 i do not give it out on the train
 not my name
 not my number
 you understand that
yeah
 i hear you
 i can respect that
 nothin' but respect

you have more than 10 items

i have to call the manager
you should become a lesbian
 it seems to be working out for everyone else

 i'll have to pass
you're so shallow

yeah
 and remember mr
 millard

 i was so happy
 that fucker
how do you pronounce this guy's name
i'm afraid to try; i might chip a friggin' tooth

i can't believe you are asking me this
do you think my parents would at least get the 50 thousand back
spare some change
 i gave some to the last guy
hey man
 this ain't a unionized situation
oh god
 that woman stinks of garlic
what
 the one picking her nose
maybe she's trying to dislodge a clove of it or something
 it's more chest-based
 like she rubbed it all over her breasts
so he digs stuff like fahrenheit 451 and all--
"451"
 9-11
 you mean
what you readin'
it's the bible in hebrew
where'd you get it
in a store that sells books in hebrew
 what's something i can learn
do you know how to use a chainsaw
 i can see if i can get the chainsaw working
how was that class for you
 was it like a war
for me
 it was more like walking through a preschool with a chainsaw
that's a cool coat
 it's pimp
thanks
did you say "pimp"
 i'm not a pimp
 i meant pimp like cool
 okay
it's not real
 i'm a vegan
you know what we need
 a nice breeze
what the fuck are you talking about
 it's cold as balls
i was being ironic
that's not ironic
 ironic is like
shit
 i don't know
 like that song
 man
 that's what people think
 but ironic is when you say some shit but you mean some other shit
motherfucker
 that's facetious
yeah
then what's ironic
how the fuck should i know
 you the nigga with the ged
i still don't understand why they say "word
well
 i think it's because they don't know what word to use
 like
 they get so excited they can't say anything else
why don't they just say like
 "wow
 that's awesome" or something
that just makes you sound like an idiot
 why did his legs pop up like that
rigor mortis
 son
 rigor mortis
excuse me
 chocolate chocolate chip muffin
 that's a little revisionist

 i don't worry about no gym so you can put more than that on
 you're skinny
 i'm fat

you know
 i can make a pork chop taste like chicken
 you want a coupon for a spicy chicken
 it comes with free fries
 you know you want free fries
 hey
 smile
 it's good for your aura
i cannot stand americans who come to the opera smelling like hamburgers
oh my god
 it so smells like fucking chocolate in here
health issues and drama at school and home
 it's like a pizza pie of misery
jesus christ
 this is like russia in the 19th century only instead of toilet paper and soap
 people are lined up to buy brie and pate
i was just hoping they would let me eat it while i got a lap dance
we're moving on to outer space--which is
 metaphorically
 cheese
oh yeah
 i remember when my hair used to smell like special sauce
i don't think it's time yet to do the professional intervention thing
 i mean if she drops down below 90
 then maybe it's time
 but i'd like to her get down to 95
 then she would be hot
 as long as she doesn't lose those 5 in her tits
 shit
 she has nice tits
 zach
 i thought of a new michael j
 fox joke
 you go into a verizon and start shaking and they go
 "who do you think you are
 superman
" and you say
 "no"
 'cause you're michael j
 fox
'cause he has parkinson's
all right
 fine
 so i gave you herpes
 now we have herpes
tobacco kills
 cancer cures smoking
 think about it
i coughed it up and everything was better
i know
 jaundice is so in now
so she's still smoking in your apartment
 and she knows you're allergic
 not cool
 you should tell her that for every cigarette she smokes during the day
 you'll put one out on her while she sleeps
see this weird thing that showed up on my leg in africa
 kind of looks like ringworm
i've been using paper towel to blow my nose and now it's all chapped
 like my ass
i want to get a tattoo on my wrist that says
 "take your vitamins" so i'll remember to take my vitamins and won't feel like shit like i always do
i used to catheterize people all the time
 and i mean 
 tons and tons of times
you know
 for a hundred dollars
 you can get that old mink stole
 i hate it when guys like
 ride the train without their shirt on and stuff
 it's nasty
you can put sneakers in the oven
 but that don't make them biscuits
and he stretched
 but he was obviously doing it so his shirt would ride up so he could show off how much weight he'd lost
 and i was like
 "ugh
 that's not coming anywhere near area
people react differently to me in a suit
 it's like they sense that it's who i really am
let me look
 i'm
 like
 the sherlock holmes of underwear
then the models come in on drugs
 still in their outfits
 vomiting everywhere
 and people are yelling
 " what did they take 
" that's what my fashion week is like
 what
 are you in stupid mode
you're having a senior moment
i wanna go see that underwear
american apparel makes me want to fucking kill myself
are they nice ties
 yes
 are they the nicest ties i have ever seen
 let's go
 seriously
 look at her legs
 it's beyond cottage cheese thighs
 her whole legs are cottage cheese
 it looks like she poured herself into her pantyhose
i have been a bartender and a waiter but i have never been the host
 there is no way to estimate how long it will take to fit someone's breast into a bra
 this is an art
 not a science
 people
i'm surprise i haven't seen nobody wearing shorts
you know
 there is something to be said for dressing seasonally
 seasonably
 whatever
 i mean
 it's cool if you want to wear a tube top to the bar or whatever
 but when girls are going out in these little tube tops
 wear a jacket
 you know
 no outfit is cool unless you're comfortable in it
 to a degree
i'm poor
 i'm poor
 i'm poor
 i'm poor

forest view rehab 
motherfucker called me a drug dealer
 son

 i slammed him up against the fucking wall 
 i smoke pot 
 i'm not a drug dealer
 don't label me
 son
and i was like
 "hello
 i was totally a speed freak in college; i think i can handle theraflu day
i am so glad we do drugs
but i took ecstasy by accident
 i was 43 years old
 it's kind of harmless; it's cute
 it's got a butterfly on it
 henry
 trust me
 you were never a fuck machine
 and i certainly did know how to fake it
 i'm tired of this shit
 i ain't fuckin' no girl behind no nigga's back
at least not that i know of
but you were disappointed that you didn't get molested
 admit it
oh my god
 that was a joke
 god
 you are sexually repressed
i just
 like
 lost my virginity three times in that pillow fight
so is this like a regular orgy
 or do i need to bring a sleeping bag
is that fucking ted
 under her
 in the same fucking position we left him in three hours ago
you gotta get to know me before you find out i'm a slut
i feel bad for her
 because what if she really isn't a slut
 what if she's just
 you know
 empowered
crazy monkey sex
so then his mom walks in and i swear to god he's buttnaked from like the waist down
 so he grabs this pillow
 and she looks over to the bed and we're all under the covers
 and you can see like
 half my back without my shirt on and she looks back at him with the pillow and then at all of us again and goes
 "you're all naked under there
 aren't you
i was supposed to be at work at 6:30 but i fell asleep on the train so since i'm late i said
 "fuck it
 i'm gonna get some mcdonalds
it's because he was trying to fuck me while i slept last night
i didn't sleep for four nights and he's trying to fuck me while i'm sleeping
he should have been happy
 i gave it to him twice last night
and once each to two of his friends
you know i'm a stripper and a model too
what do you do to top double-teaming
 fuck a corpse
so yeah
 he would go over to her house and she'd be doing two guys at once
yeah
 we'll fuck the fucker and we'll fuck him summarily
yeah
 and one time he asked me if we could just fuck without kissing
you know
 i think i'm man enough for three women
i'd let him fuck my sister
 he's a good guy
i wanna see you
 i wanna feel you
 too
 i wanna feel you inside me
 and suck on those titties
 mmm
well
 mathematically speaking
 i'm fucked
i don't steal
 i don't snatch purses
 i don't bother women
 but don't get me wrong
 i'm not a homosexual
 but i do bathe
 and i do sleep on the subway 'cause i am a bum
anybody want to take the day off and cuddle with me
 it's kosher

 god bless
the tax man has a licence to kill
 no questions asked
 more people should know that
if you see a suspicious black package on this train do not pick it up 
 if you see a large
 black package on my seat after i leave
 do worry
 it is not a bomb 
 i've been riding this train for fifteen years
 leave it for the coney island clean-up crew
 they'll take care of it
 it is not a weapon
 it is not filled with hundred dollar bills
 just don't it
did you know that union square is a hundred years older than times square
ladies and gentlemen
 sorry for the interruption
 i am trying to raise one million dollars and 25 cents for wine research
all you people who just got on the train
 everybody in this car already gave me $7
 everybody gave me $7 but you
so i saw this homeless guy walking down the street with
 like
 all the bags and stuff
 and he had something bewtween his 
hey man
 help an ugly dude out
 will ya
what's the holdup
 let's get this train moving
 there's people gots to go to work
 gots to go to school
 there's pregnant people
 court musicians
yeah
 a couple of jewish lawyers out to fuck the world
shee-it
i will never pay for the new york times 
 you remember what they did
 printing our home address and pictures of mommy and us half nude 
 i will never pay for the new york times 
 remember how mommy got letters from convicts
 because they're the only ones who have enough time to read the entire new york times 
 mommy will never give them a dime
 they're lucky i didn't sue
not really
 all they want to do is stay in my apartment and order delivery
 they're from the suburbs and don't have delivery there
i thought this was the ghetto
 but i haven't seen
 like
 a single black person
honey
 this train station is very crowded
 that is why they call it grand central station
 so this is where it to be
 the down escalator is so much easier than the up one
shit
 i like the natural history museum
 but i'd like it better if there were whores all around it
i couldn't ever take the train into work and have to deal with all the people
 the trains are dirty
 crowded
 and takes a long time to get anywhere
 that's the beauty of living in new york; you don't have to deal with those things
so i was down on canal
 buying some of that perfume my wife likes for valentine's
 some of that chanel; usually it's $45 a bottle
 but i talked this guy down to $25
 i got it home
 but before i give it to my wife
 i spray a little on my hand--and it smells exactly like roach spray
attention
 fordham preppies
 go back to the suburbs
mommy
 how old will i be when i have sex
i tell every nigga i meet that i have four kids
 and if they still want to holla
 then that's more money for me
so now she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father of the little bastard is
just a second
 more people are getting in
 what the hell
 maybe the father is on this elevator too
and i hate seeing the little children suffering
 that's the other thing i hate about winter
i used to like it when i was a child
 but then i was molested
well
 did you all know that osama bin laden was one of about 50 children
 that could actually explain some things about him
 you know
 not getting enough attention as a child
 maybe if he had been one of three instead
 we wouldn't have so many problems
please don't repeat this to anyone
for real
 dog
 all i'm saying is that
 she want to be with me
 she gots to get rid of them kids
 i ain't playing with no kids
people steal children out of this place every single day of the year
you ever notice how all the kids who walk to school smoke
 they are all thin and smoking
 and the lazy little brats who ride the bus are chubby with their legs all over each other
you are lucky you are not a kid
 i would beat your ass
stop calling him a nino
 he got hair on his balls
every time todd talks to a girl he thinks he's on a date
make out with your boyfriend for me this weekend
 i just made up such a good joke
 how do you know you're dating the dumbest bitch in the world
 she points to the other side of the street and says
 "why are they whispering
 but they're not whispering
 you just can't hear them 'cause they're far away
 dumb fuckin' bitch
well
 what do you want to do later
okay
okay
 how about we watch porn
 have sex
 and then go to the planetarium
 in that order
there are 
 my ex-wife
 i put the bitch through law school
 and then she tells me--and i 
 "i don't need you anymore
" i found her at our safe deposit box
 trying to empty everything and take it with her
 there are no normal women in this city left to date
 sorry for my language
let me put it this way: i didn't want to be hooking up with him i was hooking up with him
 i started
 and then i got stuck
but i remember you
 you spent the night at my house
he was really hot
 wasn't he
 i got his number but i'm not going to call him for at least 3 days
it was an okay date
 but we just talked about our cats
 and i was like
 " isn't sexy
 i'm having dinner with him tonight
really
he didn't say anything about handcuffs
yeah
 he cooked dinner for me
 i thought
 "finally a good nice sensitive guy
" until this lolita shows up in the living room
 "hey dad
 i'm here for the weekend
 who's this
i can either have a dog or a girlfriend
 i can't afford both
 the red is looking really good on you
 that's gonna be the next color of my living room walls
 like god had a nosebleed
take a black man home
 surprise your family
saturday was a day from hell
 i have no recollection of saturday
 because that was the day my dad said i had to choose
between a cherokee and a renegade
 now
 the cherokee was white
 and the renegade was green
 and they had
 like
 completely different features
 and finally
 i chose the cherokee
 and for that i blame my mom
 because i think she pressured me into taking a car i didn't really want
 when what i wanted was the best features of both of them in one vehicle
my favorite color is green
because
it looks like trees
imagine if you were black
 wouldn't you feel invisible
 do we have to wear bright red underwear to his birthday party again this year
i didn't want to take the bus because it takes forever
 but i also didn't see a train coming from the black hole
she must have been white because if she was puerto rican
 she would have slapped me
you already black; just go out at night
i feel like if your vagina is wet enough
 you won't get aids
fucking shit doors
 fucking shit
fuck these doors
 this is a design
 a design
 a design
 cunts
 yup
 cunts designed this
 yup
 cunts and no one else
you know i was thinking
 if you ever wanted to like take some weed on vacation
 you could just like make a fake tampon and
you know where i'm going with that one
i mean
 what are we gonna give him
 vagisil
 i think i've licked my last cunt
a vagina joke
 let's see where you're going with this
last night i had a dream i was eating my brother's pussy
do you believe she goes all the way to queens to get her crotch waxed
this guy eats me out so much he must think my name is meatball
i'm going to be the oldest person to ever have a sex change on 8th avenue
by an unprofessional
 no way
 if it ain't a brand name
 i don't stick it in my cooter
 this is perfect for when it's cold out and this in here is for when you finger me
well
 the other day she said
 "i want you to fuck me in the park
" so we went to the park
 went behind some bushes where there was a clearing and bam
 bam
 bam
 then i came on her face
he ain't licking my forehead
 he can lick your forehead all you want
 not mine
oh my god
 i recognized that huge forehead from a mile away
so i said to him
 "okay don't put it in my mouth
 put it in my face
remember when i threw cum in greg's face
 he got so pissed
hold on one second
 i'm getting exfoliated
fine
 how about i staple my balls to your forehead
i know
 i really can't believe it
 she has a face like pavement
i really want a blowjob
 i mean nosejob
 nosejob
 i don't know where that came from
what's the "n word
" dad
i'm not gonna tell you
it's worse than all the other words because it makes specific people feel bad
you don't need to know it
 it's one of those things you'll learn when you get older
 you'll learn a lot of bad things when you get older
you know where i wanna go
 the marriott
 have you heard of it
 it's in new jersey
oh yeah
 you know where i wanna go
 the poconos
what's that
i don't know
 a hotel
so was he
 like
 a player
 charlie
 that genghis khan guy
it's weird you're never horny
i just feel like sex is like bowling
 i mean
 i enjoy bowling but i'm never like
 "god
 i haven't bowled in long" or "it's friday night
 i have to go bowling
" you know
maybe you haven't found the right bowling partner
bowling is something that really isn't improved by doing it with someone else
 i've bowling but i could go the rest of my life without doing it again
 i mean
 i know i'll have sex again
 but i could give a rat's ass
 have you ever heard anyone say "i need to bowl real bad "
and she just lets him in
and you're asleep
i'm asleep
 and he comes over
 and she opens the door for him
and she leaves
yeah
 so we're alone
 right
 and he comes and
 like
 crawls into bed with me
whoa
and i sleep naked
 right
right
so i'm like
 what the fuck
you should fire her as a roommate
 it sort of turned out all right
have you seen charlie
he said he was gonna check himself into the hospital
 and probably stay for a long time
because i have some food for him
now patrick
 have you seen charlie
 i have some food for him
charlie done checked hisself into the psycho ward for two months
i guess i gotta throw the food out then
i think they should make a sequel to death of a salesman 
are you retarded
so you never finished telling me that story about whatshisname
come over here and tell me while i dookie
 don't act like i don't tell you shit while you're on the toilet
it's al hirschfeld
 a famous artist
oh yeah
 you don't see a lot of his work anymore
yeah
 'cause he's dead
last night my girlfriend called me caligula
that's really scary
 'cause he was crazy and evil
 why did she call you caligula
i don't know
 i mean
 i guess i could understand if she was talking about his big cock
communism is like anarchism
 everyone owns everything
you dumbass
 no one owns anything in anarchism
so everyone's poor
how are you not dead already
so she told me
 "i think simon de beauvoir was so brave for a man
 to write like that
" can you believe it
oh my god
how can she get a phd without knowing who simone de beauvoir was
so then why are guys from the eastern europe and black guys so good at basketball
natural selection
what
they've had to fight to survive
 it weeds out the physically inadequate
give me a break
 it's the ghetto
 not some hobbesian state of nature; they're not cavemen living in anarchy up there
i was selling some stuff on ebay
 but got scared
because they kept asking too many questions
the buyers
like what
they wanted to know if the louis vuitton bag and belt i was selling was real
 it freaked me out
so what happened
i ended the sale
 because i had two people watching me and i got scared
watching you
yeah
 they can watch to see who bids and how much they bid and then they can try to make a last minute bid
okay
 but why didn't you sell the stuff
i was scared and this guy kept asking me to send pictures
with that hat and beard you look like a jewish rabbi
dude
 it's not cool to make fun of people who jewish
so how many tombstones do we have
four
all right
 so we got the client
 the cpa and the attorney
we gotta figure out how to get one more person involved
what do you like
 then
 what do you like 
progressive rock
"progressive"
 meaning
to change with the times
 i guess as opposed to conservative rock
there is a conservative rock
do you know what the word "ontological" means
yeah
i have seen it before
yeah
 me too
is it like an orange
yeah
well
 it's something weird like that
i know what you mean
 how much are these
 or two for 18
 on macdougal they sell them cheaper
 but they're made by chinese kids who make one-fifty an hour
 capitalist bastards
 are you going to be here tomorrow
well
 tomorrow it's going to rain
 and then for the next fifteen days the government is paying me to take ecstasy and play on the computer while they observe me
well hon
 maybe you should buy both; keep the large one and find someone to give the small one to
 who do i know that needs a statue of liberty
so why didn't you come to dinner
i don't like you
so i decided to celebrate turning 50 by traveling to tibet
tibet

i wish i could get paid to sit in a hole in the ground and smoke cigarettes
dude
 all i want to do is play tennis and see my analyst
being on time is wack
things are different there
 you don't really know exactly when you're going to graduate or anything
 like
 you could show up for a final exam and the professor isn't there
and then
 it could be six more months before you actually get your diploma
 it's so totally laid-back there
i don't want to go to work tomorrow
 it's not that i don't like it
 it's just too time-consuming
 can i get this mail
 and pay for my box
 i drink a lot and today's my sober day; i want to get all my errands done

 i don't know no one with hazel eyes
i know i seen you before
 listen to me
 i know i have
 i recognize you somehow
 i know what it is: it's your fuckin' eyes
i can't date him because he has that red thing in his eye
so he was buying fish
 you gave him the evil eye
here

 listening's the new reading
you don't even have to use your eyes
and this is a cross section of the human eye

i wake up at a quarter to 5 every day
i get up to pee
every day
it's that
 or i go in bed
i'll give you one up the butt if you let me be a stay at home mom

 oh my god and this woman started yelling at me this morning
 i was like
 "please don't throw blood on me or something
 i don't hate animals; i have a dog
not around your neck
do you have a book called white supremacy by fredrickson

 you are so beautiful
 your eyes
 your hair
 are you interested in modeling
i love the way you walk
 imagine
 down a runway
it's because my heel is broken
 you fuckhead
i can't believe i kissed both of them
i kissed both of them too
that means i
 like
 kissed you
i don't even want to talk about this
so then he kissed me
 and it was really awkward
 because i don't want to get involved with that train wreck
so what did you do
told him that i really liked him
 but i was seeing someone else exclusively
you are
 and you do 
 but being in awkward social situations makes me a compulsive liar
isn't that also your excuse for drinking too much
that's really not fair to say
so what did you do after that
we did some vodka shots
 and then i passed out on the subway and ended up in brooklyn
good job
you still don't have any halloween candy
 huh
valentine's day
 it's valentine's day candy
 why do you keep calling it halloween 
you have no idea how much less anxiety i have now that i know i don't have to worry about leaving the country
not that they are kicking me out
 but you know that i can leave and come back and it's not an issue
this just makes me so excited
 when i get excited i start to twitch
 i apologize
 but it's a good thing
 you get me excited
 not in that way
 i mean
 you're my professor
 and female
 but not to say you aren't good looking
 okay
 so let's pretend i was deaf for that last 30 seconds and i'll see you on friday
i guess i'll be taking my vibrator out for valentine's
last month i thought i was in love with you
 now i realize i'm stupid
stupid in love
 just stupid
oh god
 you were flirting with him
 i was kicking his ass
excuse me
jesus christ
i said
 "excuse me"
 i said
 "excuse me"
 you could have tried to move
 i didn't try to step on you
 i said
 "excuse me"
 don't you think that when someone says "excuse me" that might have a disability
 i said
 "excuse me"
 i said
 "excuse me"
 just because i bumped into you doesn't mean i want to have intercourse with you
 you're going to try and have intervourse with me
 i'm going to tell the police
hey wait
 let me get your number
 so we can have intercourse
you just get crushes on everybody
 don't you
not really
 just on hot people
what did he say after you told him we hooked up last night
i said i was still in love with you and broke up with him before he could say anything
 did you tell your girlfriend yet
 what do you think
 i'm nuts
if i had to choose between vd and a girlfriend
i'd choose vd
valentine's day is so stupid
 i'm going to boycott it
 'cause it's so commercialized
yeah
and also you don't have any girlfriends
hey you
 do i know you
you look like a scarecrow standing there
 yeah
 it's your smile
 it reminded me
 but i've gotta find me a real man
 gotta find him before valentine's day
 can i get your number
i hate valentine's day
 it's so stupid
i'll buy you flowers
i just wanna have sex
that's what i meant
 i'll go down on you
so anyway
 happy valentine's day

okay
any democrat on this train who thinks hillary clinton could be president is masturbating in their mind
 all one hundred of them
you have a nice night
this train goes really fast
they don't run it as often
 i think because they're afraid people might jump in front of it

 for christ's sake
i'm surprised it's such a problem here
 i mean
 duh
 you got all these tall buildings
well
 any building--
 you gotta go up at least 17 stories to be sure
 otherwise you just end up in a wheelchair which is
 duh
 super-depressing
17 stories
maybe 15 for you
 you weigh more than me

 that one was pretty good
 pussy
you just called me a pussy
you are what you eat
i was walking and there was a group of dominicans talking on the corner and the only reason i understood what they were saying was because i've been listening to a lot of reggaeton
they must've been talking about fucking someone
it was so funny
 i mean i was talking to the horse in english
 and the horse didn't understand a fucking word i said
it was a spanish horse
even their dogs

there are like
 so many orthodox jews at the law school

well
 it's not like everyone else is catholic

 they're
 like
 not even close
you're a slut; that's not very catholic
don't wipe your hands on me
 what's wrong with you
 megan's father only got 25 years after she went missing

 okay
 you know what happens when you say that's stupid
you don't want 
 do you
 go look at it again and tell me what you see
well
 what do you see
is it beautiful
yeah
okay
slow down
i'm stopped at a light; i can't get much slower
the ceremony is so long
 they should just throw the diplomas off the stage into the audience
yeah
 and if you don't catch one
 sorry
 you don't graduate
so then the football team will actually graduate
the receivers
 anyway
what would happen if i suddenly went deaf
 it would take you a while to notice

 i promise it's just between you
 my psychic and my shrink
do you see what i put up with
 that's it
 it's 
 we have not had sex in ten years 
 she says she don't need it

i mean
 my mother wasn't inattentive
 she made great meals

 she cooked these great meals and then at night she'd blow every guy in town
screw me once
 shame on you
 screw me twice
 shame on me
 screw me three times
 i'm a whore
i put the "ho" in "tough road to hoe"
yeah
so like a male prostitute hitting on you is like
the tribeca or something
happy hump day
 i hope it's as fantastic as doing a line off a hooker's back
i didn't pay her for the sex; i paid her to leave afterwards
a pimp is a very lucky man
what's the difference between you and a prostitute
 yeah
yeah
 i just got back from 100 centre street

 like
 who cares if you tell a little lie
you cheated
 nigga; drank red bull
 that shit gives you wings
 you was like flyin'
there is a very fine line between stalking and making things happen
 now i've gotta go fight crime
the churro guy is not the most honest person in the world
guys just lie and lie
 they put their penis in and then they lie
if you make me come up that hill i'll be really mad 
where's the yellow incense for the dead people
can someone help me get something to eat
 can someone give me some money so i can get something to eat
 i'll take anything
 anything
that you would willingly kill for
hey daddy
 wouldn't it be funny if i choked on a piece of
was 
 it wasn't
did you just kill a 
she was in the fucking wrong
 dead uncle or no dead uncle
you know what
 there is nothing hotter than a 5 foot tall girl with a machine gun

well
 i mean
 it's just your scrotum being stapled; it's not like it's actually going to go through your testicle
i was freaking out on the floor

and they'd been trying to get pregnant for a while
 like two years
 and i just
 i thought she had so much anxiety and that wasn't the right atmosphere to conceive
 and so
 i wrote them a song called "there's a baby on the way" and a few months later the whole family was together and they announced they were pregnant
 and i told them that i'd written a song "there's a baby on the way" and that i'd written it june 10th
 and she's like
 " 's the day we found out
" and my friends in la
 they'd been trying and i played them the song and sure enough
all he does is spend time with his wife and baby
 i mean
 who would want to live like that
so you're pregnant and you don't know if it's the father
 son or son-in-law
 such a bad situation she's in
i gotta buy my baby a crib
i mean a crib

 my ex-girlfriends live there

but i am a tourist
but it's embarrassing
if you're embarrassed over what a ton of people you've never seen before and never will see again think
 you're never going to have any fun
 tourists are allowed to act like dorks
then why do you make fun of tourists in boston
seriously
 you have to be the most wonderful person in the world to do something like that
yeah
 but it's still a felony
i can't imagine dropping off my brother at the airport all like
 "i'm okay with never seeing you again 'cause you might die in battle
well
 at least he gets a whore
what
'cause you know they get whores in wars

what
 they know it's a joke
i met this girl
 she was perfect
whaddya mean
she was like a mannequin
interesting concept
he gets it up
 but he can't keep it up
 he doesn't understand he's dating a puerto rican
 he needs to keep it hard
he's irish
 you have to understand he has to drink
actually when he drinks
 it's better
 his sex drive improves
jesus
 bitch
 why you gotta be with that verizon
 they got no text message plan
 i ain't paying no ten dollars a month for no texting
 you gotta go with cingular
 bitch
 then you don't gotta pay nothing and you get
 like
 what the fuck
 a much bigger phone selection too and none of that extra charges bullshit
 and--god
 bitch
 why you gotta talk so loud
 we all don't need to hear all about your life

 i'm gonna set my mother on fire if the train doesn't come
 i'll set that bitch on fire
did you just walk in the room when he said
 "mommy"
and did he run over to you
 you cannot buy that
mommy got wasted on saturday and lost her phone
good job going poopie
 mommy
you better stop it or else i'm going to drop you
i'm not playin'
i will drop you
do not play with me
 baby
 you're a pretty baby
 you know that
 if you ever need a new stepdaddy just tell your mommy to let me know
you are the best form of birth control
 you shouldn't have married him
 you really shouldn't have married him
i always know when i'm home
 'cause my mom buys the expensive toilet paper
the thing most people don't get about techno is
 it's so emotional
 please
 he's been on my shit list since "you remind me of my jeep"
 remember that
 if i saw michael jackson
 the first thing i'd tell him is that i had hiv
brother
 brother
 i gotta tell you
i may be blind and dirty but even i don't know what you're playin'
 quit playin' that shit
he's like teyve except he's sings more than deedle
 deedle
 dee 
i mean
 james brown couldn't sing worth a fuck
 but he could dance
 he had a damn good bag
james smoke a motherfucking blunt
 i hate this cocksucker
 i hate working here
 that's what the words are
i thought it was
 "i shot the sheriff but i did not shoot the sheriff
you can't find bigger pussies than jonathan ames and moby
 right
 right
 right
i'm dying
 elvis says i'm not
 but i know i am
i can't remember his name
 but he was famous
 and he got shot
sometimes
 when i look at myself through the microscope of cold
 hard objectivity
 i think to myself
 "god
 you are 
i'm totally lesbo
 but the only woman i've ever loved is myself
then they said
 "i may have a woman's body
 but underneath it all
 i'm a 
i can't believe his head is as big as mine
 i meet people with heads as big as mine
y'know
 we just have to come to terms with the fact that sometimes we are just too fabulous for the places we are in
i thought that when i met jay he would tell me i'm not good enough and walk away
i mean
 eating your own cum is one thing
 but eating it on a pizza four hours later
 i should probably keep my voice down
i swear
 if semen touches my sheets
i love how my masturbation is so inconsistent but it's inconsistent to my control
i mean
 i've always of guys who whacked off on the subway
i don't like body fluids unless it's my own
i was straight with her
 you know
 this is who i am
 i'm
 it tastes so good
 i know you think i'm crazy but if i could put his cum on ice and drink it
 i would
 you are so self-conscious sometimes i want to punch you in the face
to the people getting off the train: push your way through the crowd
 don't let those penn station people take advantage of you
she would punch you so hard
 they wouldn't have to dig your grave; they'd just have to cover it
if this guy pushes me one more time i'm gonna have to slap him twice
once for now
 and once for the first time he pushed me
no son
 i already done told you i won't have a threesome with you and your girl
 i don't play that shit
 now i'm coming to your house later to get my weed and my money and i don't never want to speak to you again
get your bi-polar
 tri-focal ass out of here
move out of the way
 you expletive
what the fuck is your problem
 i gave up cursing for lent
 but since i know i'll be forgiven for this: what the fuck is your fucking problem
 you fucking motherfucker
 there is so much fucking space on this fucking street and you have to be up my fucking ass
 go fuck yourself
 you fucking asshole
she's like a human muppet
but not 
so to recap
 i learned tonight that isaac hayes wanted to fuck his mother and i secretly want to fuck my father
i don't watch tv; tv watches me
 i don't give a flying fuck what dr
 phil has to say about it
 i'm startin' to get this grey's anatomy shit
you know
 the first time my boyfriend and i had sex
 it was because of golden girls 
can you do something productive and get us tickets to the maury povich show 
i know i promised
i'm sorry
 i just felt that getting laid for the first time in almost a year was slightly more important than remembering to tivo the sopranos for you
excuse me
 sir
 but do you know you're 
 i do know that
 now will you stop following me
what's a "fortnight"
it's british for "ten days"; like
 "i'll be gone for a fortnight
oh yeah
 that makes total sense
so that egyptian baby girl with two heads died
 a brain infection from when they removed the extra head
is this real or from the weekly world news 
 it's real
 the extra head could only smile and blink
so the extra head could give head
it had a use
you are really a sick motherfucker
i don't need a bag
 thanks
you're going to carry that in your hand
yeah
that's fine with me
 i love customers who don't want bags
why waste them
 right
yeah
 people need to recycle
 they keep cutting down more and more trees for these bags
yeah
plastic bags are made out of trees
 right
well
 i think it's paper bags that are made out of trees
and he's like
 "are you pregnant
is that how straight people ask if you got laid
 but i'm kinda worried
yeah
 my friends from high school got pregnant like one after the other
it was like abort over here
 abort over there
i'm scared
we was killing baby fetuses every week
you know what i think the worst smell would be
 dirty diapers with rotting flesh wrapped in rubber; all set on fire
what about sulfur
 too
well
 sulfur usually comes along with the burning anyway
 and you know
 that all might smell so bad that it smells good
yeah
 you should tell dartmouth that when you interview there
i must have my cloaking device on today
get the fuck out of my way
 asshole
damn klingons
well
 everybody poops
that's the title of a book
i know
 i was making a literary reference
it's flushed like 3 times and i haven't even sat down yet
it can already tell your ass is dirty
would you like to buy some candy
no thanks
okay
 how about a threesome
do you think want to talk about princesses 24 hours a day
what do you think want to talk about
star wars 
yeah
 and she had tits like eggplants
and they were hairy
yeah
 the hairs were like this long and black
that's fucking sick
i got a doctor's appointment after school today
 my mom saw this hickey and she's taking me for a pregnancy test
 mexican mom's is crazy
that sucks
 if my mom ever tries to take me
 i'm telling her it's a civil rights violation
i already got my excuse
 i'm gonna say it busted when i was riding my bike
 that's no good
 say you was jumpin' up and down
what's a
knish
i think it's like
a hot pocket
we're not going to kfc
 their food is
 like
 poison
yeah
 they kill their chickens 
excuse me
 how do i get to the second floor
you just press "2" and wait for the elevator to go up
they just tell you what floor the exhibit is on
 but they don't tell how to get there
why do i have to pee in a cup
for a test
for a test
 do i have to drink it
hey mister
 does this train go to manhattan
i think it's supposed to
 but the n's messed up right now
yeah
 the n train's totally gay
yeah
 and not in the good way
come sign for this
 i can't
 i'm not 21 yet
it's a bookstore
 nigga

 i take it every day
could you not talk to me
bless you
who the fuck are you
you sneezed
whatever
 do talk to me again
excuse me
 we're to shoot this scene
 please move out of the way
excuse me
 trying to catch a motherfucking train
 i think you can film a movie some other damn place
 but i'm trying to catch a motherfucking train and this is where they keep them: in grand fucking central
 how you gonna play like a kid came on to you
 a four year old can't even get it up
how do you know
 you hit on a four year old
 man
 i was one
excuse me
 do you have any biographies of tupac
probably
 though they'd be with the other biographies on the second floor
but isn't this the fiction section
it is
 you might be able to find some books about him in non-fiction
"non-fiction"
non-fiction means true
and fiction means false
sort of
so if it's in non-fiction then that means he must still be alive
i don't think you understand
you know her
yeah
 the girl with a face like a chipmunk
poor thing's gonna die a virgin
she's married
 married to what
there was too much talking in that movie and not enough action
yeah
 it was all like too much communism and shit
yeah
 i don't have to remember
 i know
 what are you looking at
 i'm gonna kill you
 you keep it up
 i'm gonna kill you
 i don't need to be no cia
 fbi
 special agent man
 whatever the fuck you got
 i battle evil
 i'm gonna kill you
shut up
fuck you
 i battle 
 i battle evil every day
 you're a coward
 i'm gonna blow up that building
 i don't like evil
 i'm a peaceful man and i battle evil
go away then
i battle evil 
you shouldn't chew gum; it makes you stupider
oh yeah
yeah
 i heard that somewhere
well
 i heard somewhere that you're an idiot
 wait
 that was right here
hey mister
 wanna hear a funny joke
okay
 here it goes
a man walks into a bar
"ouch
" ha
 get it
that's the weakest shit i've ever heard
it's too bad he's not for sale
i think you can rent him
 though
how would you like your eggs

 one sunny side up
i don't
whatever

 god
 what's the louisiana purchase
you mad dumb
 that's when they illegally sold all that alcohol
wait
 aren't dinosaurs mammals
 they're reptiles
 honey
 right
you have two master's degrees
but not in lizardology
i really wish they wouldn't let musicians play here
i mean
 seriously
 it's such an invasion of my privacy
 nothing's free around here
 that's what's wrong with you immigrants
 always looking for something for free
i said "sweet"
 not "free"
i know what you meant
do they card here
yeah
 but they don't card the asians
isn't that racist
 that's like
affirmative action or something like that
when i'm fucking a cunt
 i like to hurt it
 you like to hurt a cunt when you're fucking it
yeah
 what do i give a fuck
 it ain't my cunt
 don't touch me
 you can't sit here
 people don't just sit on the floor on the train
i have
a very bad
back
then ask somebody to give you their seat
 then go see a doctor
oh no
 she didn't
so then he like
stuck his stick up her hoo-ha
like in her area
 you mean he went for the cash and prizes
yeah
 so he like
 hit her there with his stick
 and she spun around and was like
 "what the fuck
 but then was like
 "oh

" but i don't care
 it's fucked up
hello

 and i can't help you
you're giving me bullshit
 you're fucking bullshit
 illinois is in fucking chicago
 this is fucking bullshit
 see a comedy show
 is your relationship in trouble
 humor will help
 thanks
your relationship's in trouble
yeah
 like your career
it would be so crazy if we were all in an alternate universe and then saw ourselves hanging out here like we always do
then you would have to have sex with yourself
what
i mean
 if i could have sex with myself
 i probably would
you know what my mom does
 she bathes in champagne
yeah
it's supposed to be good luck
 you know
what
 does she just pour cristal all over herself or something
 i think she puts it on a sponge
i haven't read one page of that animal farm 
apparently
 because we're reading 
mommy
 do you have veins in your head
of course you do
 that's how grandma died; a big vein in her brain exploded
i don't think i never met an amish person
ain't that marie osmond an amish
 yeah
 she's an amish person
if she's amish
 why is she allowed to wear so much makeup
 they can't wear makeup
 right
 i don't know what i would do
three billion dollars is a lot of green
 what would you guys do
 i'd get me one of them golden showers
 son
dude
 that's when someone pees on you
i could become a sheriff
 don't you have to take a test to become a sheriff
 what if you have one of those disorders that you throw up whenever you take a test
well i guess you could get a note or something
oh yeah
 you could be like
 "i threw up on my test
 that's why it smells funny
 here's a note
 she want me to give her a kid
 son
 she only 28
 i'm like
 you don't need no kid when you 28
 just start in your thirties and have 'em back to back to back
you make it sound pretty easy to have kids back to back
 that's hard on a woman
and she ain't the only one
 lots of girls want me to give them kids
your sperm is in high demand
what do you want
 man
 you're a good-looking guy
i know
 i'm hot
 but sometimes it feels like a curse to be this hot
can you spare some change
 i'm sorry
is that your boyfriend
 lose him
getting some beers
 three for me and one for my dog
well
 i mean
 like for me one of the biggest issues was religiosity
 was she more or less than you
less
yeah
let me just put it this way: two days after we broke up she was wearing pants
can you spare some change
 could i have another one
what
 another dollar
 i already gave you one; fuck you
now that's what i call an ungrateful motherfucker
 do you remember how that conversation with jim started today
 honestly
well
 fuck you then
 ginka balinka
 alzheimer's bitch
so they're throwing a going away thing for him
what
 is he goin' to jail or somethin'
 he just became a corrections officer
so i had my colonoscopy tuesday
 it was like i lost an hour out of my life
what do you mean
oh that stuff they give you to make you sleepy
 it gives you
that's messed up
so my girlfriend tells me afterwords like five times that they removed a polyp and that they think it could be pre-cancerous
 i won't know until next week or something
so where do you want to get lunch
did she tell you to pee in your pants
then she didn't make you
i don't need to go anymore
i just waited in line for ten minutes
 you better fart or something
 it smells like sex in this train
what the hell does sex smell like
oops
 that's right
 you're a virgin
 well
 it smells
 well
it smells like sex
 okay
 who in this train just got some booty
 was it you
 you
 oh hell naw
 you're too ugly
you really think someone would have sex on a crowded train
i have to run in here and get more chapstick
you just bought chapstick yesterday
my dog steals them and eats them
that must be why his lips are so soft
i don't never know where you at
 baby
 i always tell you where i at
oh no
 you don't
 in fact
 i don't know where you at yesterday
well
i don't always know where you at neither
oh yes

nuh uh
 i don't never know where you at till you get from there
those are some fine-lookin' sweaters

 i made them
 you know
you made those
i did
do you think you could make one for him
i would be delighted
 you know
i mean
like
 for a chihuahua
what
 what are you talking about
 i'm talking about the johnny cash song
 a boy named sue 
and i'm talking about my dog being a cross-dresser
hold on
 i have to juggle
 i'm pushing a stroller
 walking the dog and holding a big bag of poop
yeah
 my espanol class
 it's like shitting a watermelon
what're you gonna do if i poop on myself
 what're you gonna do
is this a magic toilet
all's well that ends well
 i guarantee you that i did not peepee in my pants
why do you have to tease me by pooping at house
oh my god
 i just peed on myself
talking to you is like taking a shit
what kind of guys do you like
what kind of guys do you like
 i like guys with big tits
if i let you touch my boob
 will you stay longer
yeah
 i know
 i gotta go
 i don't have time to talk about your nipples right now
she got the ill mole on her face; her cheek look like a titty
yeah
 don't you hate it when you're not wearing a bra and like one nipple gets hard and the one doesn't
yo stacey
 you want some breast milk
well i understand that
 but that's no reason to set your nipples on fire
 i got my fried chicken at popeye's; their breasts are mad big
 they like double ds
i think i'm going to be a lactation consultant
i'm sure there are people in this world who have a fetish for big boobs and juice boxes
my dick was totally in one hand pissing while i was talking to the client
no for real
 all you need to do is give a girl a nice stiff cock and she'll let you do whatever you want
so we're goin' at it and he starts screaming and runs out of the bedroom
 and i like follow him and he's standing there in the kitchen with his dick in a glass of milk
i keep tasting weiner
and i said
 "man
 do you really want to get on your 
it's like
 "well
 it's the end of the night
 i guess i'll put this in my mouth instead of a penis
excuse me
 he has a mole on his dick
 he has a mole on his dick
nigga
 i thought you always had your dick washed by 7
i need you to give me a ride home when i get off the bus
 my grandma has been standing in front of my house for over one hour
i bet you anything she needs money again
wait
 they're actually a dime a dozen
i don't want an intern making my fuckin' coffee
 much less produce my fuckin' show
that's not true; someone once charged me seven dollars and fifty-three cents for a smile
damn
 girl
 you workin' hard
 what type of reward you gettin'
 monetary or bootitary
i made a new year's resolution to be less responsible
 but it just didn't work
i am just kicking myself for spending all that money on that stupid funeral
i'm going to get in to work early tomorrow so i can quit
you're not listening to me
 it's not about the snack
 it's about the fact that i've had a really hard day and i want to unwind a little
i would like to inform you of something you already know
 you are all very cheap
i have to cash this check; i just got out of jail and i need the money
we're being listed through mr
 vampire-man
when i see that tenants have their windows open
 i shut down the boilers
 if there's a cold snap after that and they complain that there's no heat
 i say
 "too bad
 you had your windows open for a week
he only put two thousand dollars in my account
 so we can't go too crazy
lady
 would i be selling it if it weren't any good
when she traded her kid for the house
 i lost all respect for her
dude
 he always blames it on the train dispatcher
 he needs to own his problems
 you know
move to the front of the train
 there's more room at the front
well
 you missed it
 and that was the last one
 we'll set up cots on the platform so you can spend the night
i couldn't fit on that train
 i want my money back
gentrification
 what they need to do is gentrify the subways
i'll be there shortly
i'm stuck on the train on the bridge
is 14th street the next stop
you know how we be hopping turnstiles all the time
 i get so used to it
 i hopped the turnstile on the way out the station
 cop saw me and grabbed me
 cop was all
 "date of birth
" and shit
 i'm like
 "i was going out
" and he's all
 "still looks like a hop to me
ever notice how ugly new yorkers are
don't take my word for it; just look at the person sitting next to you
where the hell is the uptown 6 train
 this is crazy
 where the hell is the uptown 6 
this is the shuttle bus for the number 2 train
 don't expect to get where you are going in an hour
 it's gonna take two
 if you don't like it
 call a car service
 or get a ride with a friend
 or stay home
well
 she didn't sound chinese over the phone
free cell phones
free blackberries
free prisoners of war
yeah
 well
 that's what i do
 perpetually disappoint people
 call my father
oh my god
 tina
 i have to go
 i have been looking for my phone for the last 5 minutes and i can't find it anywhere
did the real sex live up to the phone sex
she had yo brother when she was nine
 yo momma a freak
am i on speaker phone
mom is always listening in on the other line when i talk to dad
 the other night he said
 "you're such a nice person"
 and i said i must have got that from him and we heard a click
no guy would spend that much time texting you if he wasn't serious
 that's the worst
 when you're jerking off and a friend calls
 like you really want to jerk off
 but you really want to talk to your friend too
did you see that woman
 she looked at us like she'd never seen a black man before
i just said the n-word in front of a "n"
 the africans: they black
 the asians: they black
 there gonna be too many of us
they are some racist fuckers in there
 they wouldn't help me because they are so racist
 and you know what
 that racist motherfucker was a bin laden bitch too
i get the best reaction from the blacks
 the black people are more spiritual
 they got one up on us
 but it's not us and them
 we're all one person
 you're just a different shade of white
 and i'm a different shade of black
there's fuckin' cops everywhere
 the worst ones are black
 no wonder everyone hates 'em
four generations out of slavery
 and now i command a robot army
okay
 you are telling me 6 o'clock
 can you give that
i can you
that at apartment
there will be soap
i like to play in the dirt
and i like to do dirty things 
i can feel the juice runnin' down my leg
 it's leaking 
if i'd just taken a shower everything would have been all right
you gotta come early
 like 5 o'clock
 when they're still clean
 you don't need another dick already in 'em
that's not cleansing
 not eating anything ever is not a way of cleansing your body
the next time you complain that i don't take the trash out
 i'm going to remind you that it was not me who put beef blood in our bed
the sight and smell of it was so disgusting
 i was
dammit
 how many times have i told you
 don't lick the bird shit
dude
 i think i just farted on a model
ladies and gentlemen
 this q train is currently making local stops due to the 12 cups of snow outside
no way
 fuck 
 wind
sometimes you can't see love
 but you can feel it
 it's like the wind
whoa
 it's raining ice
they look slutty
 slutty people don't get cold
this weather crazy
 father nature caught mother nature cheatin' on him
 got mad
 and dropped some damn snow on us
i mean
 who doesn't like being warm
 it's not like they call it "global sweltering"
 so who cares
again
 the delay is due to the 12 cups of snow outside
oh my god
 i'm shopping with my mom
 and she's shopping for 
usually my bedroom is off-limits but i let my son go read in there the other night and i walk in and he's going though my drawers and he found my dildo 
and he knew what it was
 too
dude
 if they ever ask you for a massage
 don't get one
 they strap this weird dildo thing on their hands and then rub it all over your face
 then it makes this chuga chuga chuga sound
 it's ridiculous
 i've upgraded
 this one's named excalibur
 it's a rabbit
 stimulated by a 50 cent banana
i don't know
 all i remember is that when i woke up in the morning there was a cucumber with your menstrual blood on it
 what did you think of him
i don't see what he sees in him
and he's poor
 why is he with someone that homely if he doesn't have
and did you see his teeth
excuse me
 can you tell us how to get to the corner of madison and park
no such place
 see
 those streets run--
 he doesn't know
 we just came from there
 so let's just go back the way we came
hey a six-legged lamb was born in belgium over the weekend
are they sure it wasn't a four=legged spider
i mean
 a six-legged
i mean
 a spider with wool
who needs variety when we got fucking spiderlambs
let's go to the other wing
 i'm not that interested in seeing the modern art
then why are we at the museum of modern art
we're going to try to get the line moving quicker
 anyone who is in a group of 2 or more people
 have 1 person stand in line and buy tickets
 the other members of your group can go to a waiting area and you can meet them there
but what if all 3 of us want to go up to the top
and i will totally sell you my old shuffle
 cheap
i don't know
fuck that
 itunes sucks
 all iproducts suck
 you might offend the girl with the ipod
fuck her
 she can't hear us with those ear things in
excuse me sir
 do you have the time
8:45
is that new york time
i wish i could have that cookie
it's nice to wish
do you know that she got into brooklyn university
 they must let everyone in there
brooklyn university
 or maybe long island university
 or maybe brooklyn university in long island
oh my god
 i wanna be on 
like the tv show
but everything has been done already
they could make you into a lesbian
so we basically spent the entire day having sex on sunday
oh my god
 how do you get any chores done
well maybe you should start seeing a therapist
i bet you they'll just say i'm paranoid
how come you don't eat me out anymore
you have ridiculously strong thighs
when you cum you crush my head
jesus
 you're such a pussy
i want to have three kids
 first a boy
 then two girls
what if it doesn't happen in that order
there are ways to make it happen
 like
 different positions
hall of psychics 
that says "physics"
so i took out the butter
 you know
 in the butter dish
it had been an avocado
 like a year ago
so i just skipped breakfast
what did you do with it
what do you mean
 what did i do with it
like
 did you throw the whole butter dish away or what
i just put it back in the fridge
right
you remember me
yeah
 i remember you; i don't like you
i still don't like you either
 you still gotta wash your ass
 stop smokin' crack and wash your asshole
i don't normally carry a bag of vomit with me as a weapon
we should market that
spare some change for the leprechaun
 i just need four dollars to get back over the rainbow
can i kiss your shamrocks
i didn't come all the way from new jersey to watch a fucking parade; i came here to drink
 i am wasted
dude
 this is the anniversary of my nipple piercing
i just wanted to say that
 you're not wearing green
i'm not jewish
i thought it was irish
have you ever been on the east side on st
 paddy's day
 i was there last year
 and there were guys--grown men--wearing business suits and everything
 just pissing in the middle of the street
 it was magical
god bless the irish
 and god bless john gotti too
if you're wearing a green hat like that i get to bitch-slap you
why is everyone wearing green today

totally
wait
 i don't get it
the last guy she slept with was eleven inches
well
 she is from queens
what's a pipe dream
it's like a farfetched dream
yeah
 i always thought it was
 like
 an idea someone got when they were high and they thought it was a good idea at the time because
you know
 they were stoned
you're retarded
i don't get it
 c-town has more of a selection
i don't know why you have to ruin this experience for me
when i got on the bus today
 there was a needle on the seat next to me and i didn't know what to do with it

 i wouldn't give her the satisfaction
yeah
 we were with the ugliest girls in the world that night
you should date the jew; he would take you out to dinner and then they bone you
 as opposed to the catholic ones that we just bone and skip dinner altogether
life is just a game
totally
some people do crosswords
 i wake up in the morning
it's happening again
 my eye is twitching
 i don't see anythinig
 are you sure

 i can feel it
 i can feel it but no one can see it
 it's twitching

 they have their fake press-on nails and damn fake hair
 and they spend all day running their fake nails through their fake hair instead of watching the keyboard
 you're just jealous
what was the name of your vibrator

 it was my first one: sergei
what
 why did i say pedro
 where did that come from
my first 's name was pedro
i didn't know what to do
 so i took a used tissue out
 but i
it's better than letting it drip on the table
yeah
sometimes the office gets so hot
 people come in tank tops
i know
one time i went to a meeting and a drip of sweat fell from my head
 i was mortified
oh my god
why do they put peas in the fried rice
 peas and carrots
 i don't want that in my fried rice
because it's vegetable fried rice

 because if you let it go it will be meat
i think it's produce

she told me
 "mitch

yeah

you know
 if she throws that cooter in your face you're gonna be eating cooter for dinner tonight
i just talked about rimming and clitoral stimulation on an academic panel
 how do you i feel
she was sitting there spread-eagle
and all my friends got a glimpse of the gobbler
i have every confidence in her as a person
 but that doesn't extend to her being able to contract her vaginal muscles into the shape of a whooping crane
my clit isn't that big
 but it is perfect
 it's very active
today was the first day i took a celebrex since the pogo stick thing
so i went to the gynecologist today
yeah
 it was cool
 like

you don't need no doctor's note to shave your ass
it sucks that it's due to brain cancer
 but i am just so glad to have some time off

 i just know it
so i was walking past a busy high school
 folowing this big
 middle-aged guy 'cause he was cutting a swathe through all the teens
 then then he stopped dead and i almost walked into him
 i checked to see why he had stopped
 and he was making out with a teen
you was still with your wife when you was fucking me
 right
that's like our little routine
 we have sex and then i stand on his back and crack it
 just like that: sex
 crack
 sex
 crack
 ladies

but i have a taser
 so if he says anything i don't like
 i can just zap him
we met up with these girls last week and hooked up with one of their friends in the bathroom

how do you accidentally bend it
 i didn't mean to
did you want me to replace this card with a new one that's not bent
yeah
 that would be great
because we don't do that
we need to think of a nationality for me
because at parties people always ask me what i am and i feel so boring saying "white"
say you're australian
and argentinian
 i'm gonna be australian and argentinian
what's going on
apparently someone is a motherfucker
 if i had a baby and it was really ugly
 i'd say flat out
 "that baby is ugly
" and i'd have to try again
 just dress it up good
 no one will know
did you know bush agreed to share nuclear technology with the indians

that's right
 all you wanna do is sleep all day
 you wanna go to bed right now and sleep for four days
 24/7
 fucking worthless
 you should fucking die for that
people are always saying i look asian
 do you see it
well
 you know
 mexicans look a lot like asians
yeah
 they have those same narrow eyes
and they're short
you'd better get out of the way
it'll be $3 to get off the train
i'm getting off this train if i have to climb over you
climbing over me is $5
it's not that i'm against marriage
 i mean
 i like weddings
 it's 10pm
 has anyone seen my husband
she told me she wants to make it with 2 cock and a pussy
what can i say
 she's my wife
 i want her to be happy
he's marrying her 
 the last i heard
 he said she had a big ass
it's either have lots of kids or marry lots of women
oh my god
 you just got engaged 
that's so exciting
wait
did you say 
 oh wow
 so you like have a ring
yeah
 i'm covered on his insurance even though we're not married
i know
 we are domestic partners
 and we're not even gay
i tried to break up with him for four years and never managed; that's why we got married
actually
 now that i think about it
 i guess i've had sex in both of the sheratons
i got laid 4 times
 and i got 23 of the guys laid
 i was like you
 blondie
 go with him
 you two dames over there
 go with this guy
you know
 marv makes things happen
i wanted to fuck his eyes
i fucking love you
 i wanna fuck your face
and he kept saying
 "i don't wanna use a condom this time" and yada yada
 so i was like
 "whatever
 let's just do it
 then"
i was tired of arguing with him
so i finally hit that 17 year old the other day
if i don't come back with a spring break std i'm going to be disappointed with myself
suck my fallopian tubes
 his semen is so backed up
 when he does fuck her
 he's gonna kill her
yeah
 did you hear that the bald eagle isn't extinct anymore
 look
 how funny
 that alligator's eating a baby
what should i do
 that lady is complaining of 
people like shouldn't have animals
 they don't know how to them
it's about bugs
 well
 it's about burying bugs
but i've always wanted to tell you
 you're a peacock to me
 i mean
 you remind me of a peacock
 never mind
but we'll never know
 because cows don't live that long
oh my god
 you guys
 if you ever wanted to be a penguin
 this movie will totally make you think twice about it
 that nigga is a pyromaniac
 he lights animals and shit on fire; i seen it
 and one time he lit an animal on fire and you know
 i got angry
why do new yorkers sound like when they talk
she always loved the ratboy best
i see you walking all those dogs
 what is that called
 again
well
 i've never seen a black bear that could suck its own cock
 but i have seen one take a shit
the only reason she was hanging out with those dudes is because she was hoping that one of them would kill me
but that's neither here nor there
it's not a lifecycle
 it's a deathcycle
here's my issue
i have to get to work
 and you're playing dead on the subway
i don't want a cookie
 i want a piece of toilet paper
 and i want to kill myself
 in that order
 i don't want to have to pee when i'm killing myself
what if you woke up on morning and came outside and saw a man hanging on one of those bayonets above people's heads
 just some dead guy
 it should have disintegrated by now
 except for
 like
 the bones and stuff
 i'm so excited
 honey
 the murder happened before the renovation
he wants to kill himself by getting a ferrari
 a really expensive pair of leather pants
 like
 that cost $1000
 a lot of coke that he'll put in the back of the car
 and then
 you know
 go off a cliff
yeah
 i wouldn't mind being buried there
my whole family's dropping dead and i'm just tanning
i know you're not religious
 but do you believe in dinosaurs
you think you'll be young forever
 time flies by like lightning
like lightning and thunder
 just like jesus
my roommates and i built shelves for our loft this weekend
 it didn't take long
 though
all we have are computer books and bibles
i am really weird
 like you know how like when people's conscience is talking to them how there is the angel over one
 really
 if there is a god
 he that party
is forsook a word
please
 i friended god on myspace last night
it was like
 way underground
 i think it was in hell
god is not shit
 he is immortal and he will hurt you
he just wanted me to be
 like
 this christian warrior that i just was 
you are all a bunch of cocksuckers
 you are christian rock without god
i wish jesus could taste better
and then he said
 "you should try this toothpaste
 it's awesome
it's like the messiah came in your mouth
jesus wasn't white
 i'm sorry
 i'm sorry
 if his dad was black with nappy hair
 what'd you think his son gonna look like
you want to see the ugliest person
look over there at the lady in the brown coat
 don't look though
 it could be scary
 it'll electrify ya
 scare ya stiff
 that
 my friends
 is ugly
you should appreciate what you have because some people don't have noses
why is that girl supposed to be pretty
 i mean
 why look at her at all
girl
 you fine
 your hair is beautiful
 i'll let you brush mine if i can brush yours
nice pictures
 they look nothing like you
why even look at an eight
 nine or ten
 when you can fuck a four or a five
my eyes were burning he was so ugly
 i swear
i saw a more attractive version of you on the street today
 when my grandmother see me in this
 she gone have a strizzoke
this is not a scarf
 it's a man-pashmina
well
 my hat guy is over there
keep an eye on my purse
that guy in the subway told me i shouldn't be wearing sunglasses 'cause i won't get enough air since you breathe out your eyes
yeah
 but that's like those fake louis vuitton purses you see those whores with clear heels carrying
 they're cute but not 
is that coat too rabbinical
she has the amazing ability to make even the most fabulous outfit look totally ordinary
i didn't really see this on your resume
 but
 you managed to find time to cheat on a guy for over a year
 but you don't have 2 hours to go suit shopping
your earrings are big enough to fit my scrotum through
 naw
 you gotta tell him
 we ain't down with the broomstick
oh shit
 you did that right in front of your girlfriend 
yeah
no fucking way
 how did it taste
salty
i will dip my cookies in your tears
i'm making a quilt
 motherfucker
honey
 you can't let a vacuum cleaner ruin your day
yeah
 you can braid
but can you macrame
well
 i know he's worried i'm gonna like shove it in an oven
first i'm gonna tell her i love her
 then i'm gonna cook her some ribs
they were making out on a sewing machine
when all is said and done
 i was drunk in banana republic
i wanna be a lady
hey do any of you guys like comedy

 we can go get drunk
 pick up some drunk girls
 then bang then after the show
i am tipsy
 i just want one more glass of wine
 it's because i'm stressed

 i just want another glass of wine
they really need to have places where you can get drunk with your pet
 that would be so much fun
i'm not drunk; i'm jewish 
i thought that we might go out drinking so i brought my diaphragm
i'm going to a gay bar
 i'm getting really drunk
 and i'll try my best to keep my clothes on
i'm the kind of person that goes to group meetings drunk
 because i can't handle it
if i'm drunk enough for karaoke
 i'm already passed out

 i don't care if i get to blow picasso
 i'm not waiting in this line
 i can't believe i took a fucking adderall for this
this next painting is by claude monet

i really just want to call it abstract realism
these flowers
they're so beautiful
 i want to draw them in my sketch pad
i need to buy a sketch pad
you know
 if we move the two warhols we can put the plasma on that wall
 if they didn't wan't us to touch the sculptures they would have a sign here that says
 "don't touch"
i just think all minimalist paintings look like flags
you know
 mark rothko: welcome to japan 
wait
 what
 you have gandhi on your phone
he only calls me when it's convenient
 "hey
 let's have sex
normally when i doesn't answer my phone
 16 days in a row
 it means i don't want to talk to you
 i bought two ringtones today and had enough money to have pizza for lunch
so yeah
 i'm getting so good at this sort of thing
 i was talking to this woman on the phone the other day and i could totally tell that she was an aquarius
why do people always walk with their heads down
 just saw a guy talking on his cell with his head down and he walked right into
that's the problem with today
 you never know if someone is crazy or if they have one of those headset things
you havn't put down your phone once since we got here
 this was supposed to be quality time 
 has your little friend jamie text messaged you recently
 actually she hasn't
that's right
 because i called that fucking bitch up and told her to find her own man

 whatever
 so the guy who runs the website is all
 "no

 there's another train behind us
look
 that is the third time your purse has hit me in the head
 i asked you nicely to please move over
 this is not a seat
 it is my shoulder
 and you are sitting on it
 the train is not crowded and there is no reason for you to be on top of me

 if you insist on waiting for the v train
 one should be along at about 5am monday morning
yeah
 i have to go
 i'm too distracted on the phone
 and i don't trust anyone in this terminal
 people are speaking spanish behind me
 if you know what i mean
 you know
 it's okay

i quit that job
 they treated me like i was a mexican
i don't know what you want from me
i don't dance and i don't speak spanish

 i didn't like it
 i mean
 puerto rico is like the new york of mexico

 all drawing is naked drawing
 especially when you're spanish
 and new
i'm starting to see a lot more blacks and hispanics around here
 we must be in "da hood"
i talked to her for 10 minutes and figured out she was crazy
you guys aren't here to help me; you're just here to bust my balls
 what the fuck is wrong with all of you
 lemme get through
 my roommate was having issues with his girlfriend who's psycho and he goes to my other roommate for advice
 well
 he's cheating on his girlfriend who's also psycho
if i was a crackhead
 i would not go to a crackhead to figure out how to stop smoking crack
i don't what planet they think they from
 but these humans ain't all they cracked out to be

 i step in dog shit all the time
 i used to play the horses
 one time i stepped in dog shit and then i won $750

 but clean the bathroom
 rob
 i'm sure it's disgusting
 okay
i'll kill you

if i fucking pee myself it's not my fault
you're so lucky i didn't have my uti
 i would've wet my pants
where's your section for books about hippies
 did you notice that guy standing in the doorway is reading how to win friends and influence people 
 and he's standing in the doorway 
but i think our conversations right now are at the height of what conversation could ever be
 the only thing that could make them better is if we read books
 carol
 do we have the book in hindi
there was a guy that was helping me before
 he's really smart and it's like he was reading my mind
 do you know where i can find him
if they don't get that motherfucker by the end
 i ain't never gonna read another richard north patterson book again
yeah
 netherlands
 like peter pan 
 right
all the women in this book get screwed
 literally and physically
i've never been blonde

 it was like
 "what hole did that tribal crawl out of

i can go back
 i can go front
 bob is gay

 i've got a life
 and
 i got your man on top of it
yeah
 after i slept with her brother's boyfriend

 maybe that chinese kid farted egg roll
and i was like
 "great coffee" and
 "can i have some change

 and then
shit
 i just realized i forgot my change
this is grand street
 everyone
 grand street
 chi-town
 homemade bok choi
you're chinese and a virgin

chinese takeout people are so stupid
 they can't even spell "dynasty"

korean girls are crack dealers
the chinaman
 he's incredible
 he fits more in his restaurant
 in half the size
 than anyone else
 it's amazing
come get your umbrellas
 100% genuinely made in 
the thing about chinese weddings is that after you go to
 like
 three of them you realize you're not chinese

 it's where they train hunters
 elmer fudd goes there
uh hum
i heard that if you inject enough [mumblemumble]into his bloodstream
 in a couple of hours
 the coroner can't tell the cause of death
woof woof
that isn't fucking funny
 piece of shit
 fucking hors d'oeuvres on wheels
have you heard of the sleeper

i thought eskimos were darker skinned
i thought eskimos were darker
 i think their skin is darker
i think they have darker skin

 and i'm less than prepared
fucking tourist

you can't use it this often
 you come here every day and stay there for 20-25 minutes
 i don't know what you're doing in there
well if you want to get so technical
 the first time i was taking a dump
he took it; it'll both depict us
i don't want to be both depicted
 i want my own shit

can anyone spare some change for a homeless man
 can anyone spare a penny
 nickel
 or dime
 penny
 nickel
 or dime
 shit

 i got to get off this train
 get out of my way
you're not going to get much with that sales pitch
and the area is really gentrifying quite nicely
very safe
 the people from the projects never come over to this side of the neighborhood
 so it's a great place to raise a family
could you folks help me out with some money to buy food
 give me money
 i haven't eaten in three days
sorry
 i work on commission
 [to his clients]

well
 i'm an american and i don't know
i know
 haven't they figured out yet that if you hang around the nation long enough
 you'll get hired
they hire anyone

my boyfriend likes to bite
what
 you dating vampires now but you still won't go out with tommy
dude
 so if you had a pencil
 and she was naked
 you could totally fit the pencil in the folds under her ass
 she's just flappy
 man
yeah
 dude
 your vagina's open
 right
yeah
and there's a smell
and it's a personal smell
so my friend from new jersey just texted me
yeah
yeah
 she's pregnant and wants to me to be the godfather
 that dude's hair is always fucked up
 he don't got no hair
 i mean his head is fucked up
what's that

that's the guggenheim
 you know what time it is
 you got a face so pretty
 i swear i'll have to cut you if you don't tell me what time it is
five thirty
i just left a major deposit sitting in that toilet
you didn't flush it
it was an automatic flusher and nothing happened
 there was a guy waiting to go in and i just gave him a shit-eating grin when i walked out
 i mean
 what am i supposed to do
i wouldn't use the term "shit-eating grin" the next time you tell that story
i heard he's in some shit
 married
 two kids
 child support
yeah
 that's some shit
 and now tell me honestly
 is it better to have sex high or not-high

yeah
 did you put it in
you don't understand
i was feeling her down there
 and she
duuuuuude
she had a cock
yeah
 did you put it in
i think true love is when you know someone isn't perfect but you still think they are
i thought love was when you could still feel butterflies in your heart even after he tells you he thinks he's an elf
i keep forgetting that actually happened
yeah
 and not to you
yeah
 i don't know how i would have taken it
that was so good
 i'm so full
yeah
 if this were freshmen year
 i would totally go puke
so you like the kid more than the pussy
are you crying cause you're really hurt
 or are you crying cause you're a baby
you are married and have kids
 you can't just fuck a bunch of guys because you think you missed out
do not co-inhabit
 i repeat
 do not co-inhabit

the english people that lived on the island respected her because she is italian
 and the english respect italians because they respected the romans

 i'd slice a bitch for a pork chop
[something in spanish]
 how do you say "altar boy"

 the ones whose little dicks the priest sucks
i wish i was jewish -- i'm hungry
the catholic church is so stupid
 i mean
 harry potter--he's a good kid
 and there's good and bad everywhere
 just look at all the bad shit the catholic church has done
 can tell you through telekenesis all the bad shit that church has done over the years
for christ's fucking sake

 i mean
 most korean girls are really photogenic

 i know he sued me and everything
 but it just feels so good
you do not have a receptive bone in your fucking body
can i just tell you how much i hope my manager gets hit by a car
you never want to go to barbados when i want to go to barbados
the audacity of him tearing up this beautiful african-american pussy and not calling me afterwards
a billion guys finger fuck a girl and walk away
 why i gotta get the only man who thinks it's love
isn't "volvo" the medical term for a vagina
he was all over me
 he said he couldn't get enough of me
 of course he has alzheimer's
 look at that
 honey
 those would make great earrings
hello
 preemie
 how's your vagina
and the hotline to tell me what my incurable disease is is only open from like 7 to 9
 and like
 you can't tell me my blood is dirty and then have the hotline close
yeah
 everything seemed to have checked out okay
 but when the doctor came back with my urine sample he said he was concerned about my pee being to dry
we can damn near make blind people see and we don't have an orange peeler
i woke up the next morning and there was a thong that said "eat me" on it in my bag

 i refuse to move to california
because i refuse to have a spoiled brat for a child
 i would want to raise them in new york
if we're rich

yeah
 but i'd rather have a hamptons brat than an oc brat
 i just tie it up with string and put it next to my nutsack
that's why i don't go to that church anymore

 pushing others and possibly risking a fall
 an injury

the thing is
 dating gets so much harder as we get older
yeah
 especially if you're intelligent
it's not like you can just look at a woman and tell if she's smart enough to date
true
i'd never date an aries though
well you know

 i can't say i'm crazy about the constant nosebleeds and cravings at all hours of the day
 but it's worth it anyway
 my appetite's gone
what
have you ever been to d
 before
yeah i used to go there and go to museums all the time for spring break because i'm not a
 you know
 go-to-mexico-and-get-date-raped kind of person
the thing
 don't they have dead babies there
 dead babies are the best type of babies
sometimes i wish i was a mexican
 like
 a mexican boy
 life would be so much easier
 [pause] you know
 because they always have a lot of roommates
 like
 15 mexican boys live together
 that's why you broke up
 i don't blame you -- you gotta microwave them first
 otherwise they're too spongey

 your standards are just off because you dated a fetus

don't think of it as losing a friend
but as gaining a holiday destination
 but is this makeout room
 i noticed it before but i never realized it was the makeout room
i mean
 we were
 like
 walking on this little scenic trail by the river looking down the hill and we see rocks
 trees and
 like
 gay sex
 there aren't any fire escapes in this building
 at least not any that we have access to
i'ma go back to 1903 when there wasn't nobody around
so where's the fun aisle
did you hear
 peter got the good cubicle
 with the high walls
biotch
 spelled b-y-o-c 
 some shit like that
 it's chinese
and as i walked out the door i said to her
 "one last thing - if your pussy is so good
 why don't you eat it yourself
that guy smelled like a bag full of assholes
uh huh
 and that's why you have herpes
 dude
this place is way gayer than last time
well
 tonight i'm either hanging out with fags or lesbos
 all we do in that class is talk about gay porn for 3 hours
nigga can't get a woman anymore because every fuckin' man is 
 every time i open my eyes i see gay men 
 no more straight men out there
 can't fuck a woman anymore because they all want the gay men 
 i ain't ; i like 
 that's why we got aids because every man's a gay man 
 you stick da dick in da butthole you get aids
 gotta stop stickin' da dick in da butthole
 every man is and that's why we got aids
 all dem dicks in da buttholes
 how's my wittle faggot today

who is male
you gonna get beat by a faggot
as soon as i met him
 my gaydar exploded
and then i had to change my pants

now i hate homosexuals for all the right reasons
 they're not going to kill you
 mormons don't kill
excuse me
 miss

 i'll have a fag attack if you don't stop those shoes right there
if i had my way
 i'd take all the homosexuals and burn them in auschwitz
i've fired 3 people in the last 2 weeks
 one girl was fat
 but she didn't know it
 she would come into work with her belly falling out of her shirt
 i just couldn't take it anymore
well
 my diet pills are kicking in so i have to get off the phone and go to the gym
ever since she went skeletor she
 like
 gets everything
i can't decide if eating will make me feel better
i'm not bad in bed
 you're just 
 these people need to realize they're and they are too 
 women in this country are 
 you can't be on this train because you're too 
buddy
 your balls aren't as big as my ass
 so shove over
why is my leg fat so fuckin' jiggly
just because she's heinous doesn't mean i'm not trying
well
 she weighs more
 than
 like
it's her attitude that makes her heinous
 though
i need to work on my abs
so what time are we meeting them to go to the restaurant to eat
yeah she's not big as a house
 maybe a small cottage
you know what i mean
 man
 they got these 400 pound cops comin' in and arresting people for weed
 man
 you know what i'm saying
 it's the same thing
 though
 they're addicted to food and it's okay
her ass was so small
 she was worthless
she fat for a girl that ain't fat
 'cause girls ain't supposed to be fat
oh my god
 she was like a size negative zero
with this many books you are almost certain to make a mistake in your choice
do you have malcolm x's autobiography
 i don't know who wrote it
i read all of pride and prejudice in one day
 and then i realized that it's stupid
 and disgusting
 and that jane austen is superficial
yeah
 man
 narania
 you know
 like the witch
 the wardrobe
 and the lion 
 narania
if i were you
--and i am just that
 a time-shifted version of you--i would open the book to appendix c
in english
 it means "less miserables
did i say barnes and nobles
 i work at starbucks
 yeah
 starbucks
 actuarial
 that's like birds
 right
dude
 i'm not a racist
 i went to berkeley
well
 that's the great things about history papers
 i once wrote a four page paper with eleven citations
 it was fucking awesome
if i weren't poor white trash
 i'd be fully ivy league educated
that's why i'm so bored at nyu
oh yeah
 you know what i need to learn about
 the metric system
i can't date a woman who's taller than me
 actually
 i can't date a woman who's a lot smarter than me
 either
 but then
 i haven't met any smart women
you teach literature in a school and you talk about the president 
 at least he's done something with his life
that's plagiarism; that's different than ripping someone off
i'm never going to be in the "in crowd" because the "in crowd" are all molecular biologists and have labs
i haven't been inviting everyone; i just told them they could fucking come
i know it's going to be boring
 but we'll have so much fun that we won't notice how boring it is
she didn't even invite her children to her birthday party
yeah
i don't know for sure
 she said she was trying to cut back the guest list
so we'll finish up sheet 15 and move onto sheet 16
 it'll be a party
 i can't wait
 it'll be my "sheet 16" party
i think it's "alzheimer's"; they're old but it's not "oldsheimer's"
if you get in that cab
 i'll hide your viagra your teeth

 no one else on this train likes children 
look
you are 6 years old
 right
 and your brother is 4
 and i'm
you know
 i can't wear acrylic nails no more
 i flew off the handle and grabbed michael so hard they started cracking and making my fingers bleed
 and i can't be worried about bleeding fingers when i'm punishing my son
 i'm being assaulted by a child
 wait
 i'm from harlem
 i should be chasing you
 argh
 i'm from harlem
 argh
 i wouldn't have kids; you have to buy them little red jackets
 and that cuts into your beer money
 you've got them running all over your house while you're trying to smoke a joint
 kids should be drinking liquor at 12
 drink liquor
 kid
your voice
 it's just like my kids
 i tune it right out
 this is why i hate you fucking people
 you act like monsters
you heard they called acs on that bitch
how you let your baby fall out the high chair

 i was there until 1:30
 they loved me
well
 we don't
 you talk too loud

 i've been calling for someone and waiting in aisle 2 for ten minutes
 and no one came
 this is ridiculous
 you people are incompetent
 you have things stacked so they fall
 look at my pants
so why are you telling me
because you work here
 lady

why did you move my beverage to the floor
you're not supposed to have drinks on the train
 especially not on the seats
it's not going to spill
 are you a cop
 i'm a taxpayer

yeah
 i'm a cop
can you be a taxpayer and a cop
if you could take over any country which one would you pick
what do you mean
 "take over"
you know
 weapons
 resources

 stuff like that
that's a hard question
 i mean
 i'm not that well traveled
 people are so different in every country
 different cultures
well
 what if you could spend a year there
 get to know the place
i stayed the night at her place and woke early
 she was still asleep
what did you do
i got up and was going to make myself breakfast
 but when i cracked the egg open it got away from me
where did it go
it slid down a crack between the counter and the stove
what did you do
i put everything away and climbed back into bed
you know that shit is going to stink
yeah
 i'm sure it will
 this quarter say pennsylvania on the back
 ma'am
 it's a commemorative quarter

"bitch"
 "retarded"
 "gay"
 "fag"
 "slut"

 it's offensive to gypsies or something
do gypsies even to nyu
 let alone college
maybe she's from romania and shit
i may not be able to drive you to the sleepover at joey's father's house on friday
 it's in the opposite direction and there won't be time
 what we maybe can do is drop you off there saturday morning

yeah
 like today
 i ate a powerbar and i've had to shit like crazy so i keep farting
but you can't do it in class 'cause then it smells and people know it's you
you can stick dryer sheets in your pants and then it doesn't smell as much
but how do you keep them in there
well
 if your pants are tight enough
 where they gonna go
or sometimes you can ask to go to the bathroom and when you stand up your ass cheeks squeeze together and you can't fart
but in the two seconds before you're standing you can't control it
 then you fart

 i didn't realize that beth was like that
so what did you do

maybe i am
i can't believe you hang out with that guy
all of your friends are such losers
well
 i hang out with you

i think that proves my point more than it does yours
well most of your friends are losers anyway
 who cares what they do
 of them's engaged
this reminds me of the time my son caught us having sex in his bed
which one
the second time for my older son
yeah
that was the filthiest sex ever
 you need to cut from that side of the meat
 last week you gave me a cut from the right side
 i want a cut from the left side
 don't you know that i want a fresh cut of meat 
only way you gonna get a fresher cut of meat is if i take it from your wrinkly white ass
i felt a pop so i looked back and the string had broke
how will you get it out then
i don't know
 bend over and stick a tweezer up there
 imagine if i can't get it out and i have to go to the hospital
 they'll lock me up
 people get weirder stuff than that stuck up their ass all the time
 like animals and shit
you know whose coochie smells
 don't take this the wrong way: white girls
 white girls' coochie always smells nasty
 every white girl i been with
 their coochie is stank
you know why
 it's 'cause white girls live far from the ghetto
 and they have a longass train ride to get to the ghetto
 and by the time they get to your house in the ghetto
 they sweating and waiting and their coochie stinks
i give you jesus
is that mel gibson
 you nitwit
there's a six hour minimum wait for a suv
what
to get a suv
 it's a six hour minimum wait
what you mean
 "a six hour minimum"

so we can only rent it for six hours
there's a very large building missing from my neighborhood
a building missing
 have you been smoking the dope 
bitch

but i can't get a license
 i really want to scare him tonight
"citizen's arrest
" is the fastest way to get capped in new york
the guy was standing over my baby shooting a gun; how did i not wake up 
when you're 25 and you measure your hourly rate in three digits it takes a hell of a lot of grief to not make it worthwhile
i woke up this morning
 got on the train
 and i asked
 "why
 god
 why was i born so poor
you know
 if you're born into poverty it's because you did something really bad in a previous life
and then september 11th happened and my job prospects were gone
so that sucked
i went on vacation and when i came back i didn't have a job
i'd rather lick that man's ass than go to work today
i was thinking of just taking the day off and masturbating
what i don't understand is why they send someone out on training while everybody else is out on disability
 that just doesn't make any sense
yeah
 it's like all three of our neurons are coming together right now
people who didn't go to stuy are random
are those mountains over there
 what are mountains made of
this kinda science is extra stupid and hard 'cause i'll never use electrons and neutrons
 that's why i don't get it
it's awesome
 so they really make you take it out to measure it
why am i getting fatter if i keep running around all over the place
 it's like i defy the laws of physics
my drama teacher said that she looked like she had been fed with a shovel as a child
he was my favorite teacher

janis looks like nicole kidman with a drop of down's syndrome and a spoonful of howard stern
there are so many 80s looking chicks in here it's not even funny
can i tell you
 i saw the hottest guy on the way to work today
 i think he was coming from work because he was in scrubs
 i mean
 he was in scrubs and he was just so hot
 so i followed him for a while
 and i didn't realize he was sprinting so i almost got hit by a cab
 but he was just going to get his car
 but i really wish i did get hit by that cab so he could come and save me
 yeah
 i'm a little embarrassed i was following him
 but whatever
 he was hot
whenever i see someone who looks sluttier than me
 i think i'm doing something wrong
look at all these ugly faces
 these are the ugliest fucking faces god ever breathed life into
welcome to the titanic of airliners
i want to speak to whoever booked this seat for me

dude
 why your left nut
because it's attached directly to your heart
oh my god
 what bio class have you been taking
people tell me that i have an "i think i'm better than everyone" complex

 that i don't think i'm better than everyone
 i i am
 i'm more intelligent
 more thoughtful
 more articulate
prettier
well
 i don't know about prettier
 but i know i'm better than most people
i know

but not all asian girls are pretty
oh i know
 but he just thinks that
 on a scale of 1-10

 and maybe my sister doesn't want to be found
 and if something that bad happened
 they would have come over to the house
 even if they found her dead i would accept that
 because i believe in god
i can't believe you dragged me here; i don't know any of the moves
 you guys

 insensitive
 stingy and on top of all that he's got stupid hair
and he had
 like
 shark teeth
 three fucking rows of them
 i swear
one day these guys robbed this motherfucker
 they threw a small dog into the window and when the dog was killing this little dog they stole 
 motherfucker was still shaking the dead dog in it's mouth when the dude got home
damn
 that silverback looks just like my uncle
there were so many rats
 so many of 'em that it pulled diana ross right outta me
 i was all
i am gonna rip her cunt out then have a dog fuck her in the ass
 by the way
 your dog snores
first you eat dog shit
 then you eat cat shit
did i ever tell you i had a monkey for
 like
 two days
it was so quiet
 you could hear a rat pissing on cotton
love is just a hornet's nest of emotions
 you're in love
 you're jealous
 you want to kill the person they're with
no one else feels this way
they have the most ghetto-ass aquarium ever
 there's like
 a twenty foot shark in a bathtub
after studying
 i would
 like
 defrag by watching spice world 
i would rather on my than watch that fucking movie with him
it feels like i'm walking through the matrix
i fucked tony curtis in the ass
so you agree
 top gun the greatest movie ever
but roger moore be cool while parkin' yo car
 and sean connery be cool while kickin' yo ass
i liked it
 but there was like
 too much cinematography
i met clive owen once
 at the natural history museum
 he was standing alone in a corner and just started talking to me about sulfur
teen wolf ii was the pinnacle of civilization
so they're paying the kidnappers child support
 i mean i know they want to support their child
 but where is the money going
 to those crazy people
so they actually for you to go to math camp
having kids is not expensive
 it's keeping them alive
 how you gonna charge tax on flowers
 they come from the earth
 from the earth
 man
so then he was like
 "i'll give you 8 million dollars if you let me take a shit on you
" so i told him that he was buggin' and that he need to shut up
 i'll give him a discount
 all right
 the "you're-a-thorn-in-my-side-now-just-buy-a-couch-already" discount
don't buy from canada

 that's the same day as the lay-in for the children of uganda
 god
 i know
 she was so small i felt like stepping on her

 the special people line
omigod

 but he has a perfect body
was he a virgin
yeah
 i think so
i bet
 he totally needed a new haircut
do you sell tights with feet
sorry
 we only sell stuff that's trendy
foods do not make attractive accessories
we are not a society of homer simpsons
homer didn't have food accessories
but don't you think he'd have liked them
you know
 relationships are a lot like the british government
 the queen thinks she's in charge
 but the prime minister has all the power
i wonder if people in the real world are subjected to this kind of conversation
hey baby

this your first time at the empire state building
yeah
 it is
cool
 where are you from
native new yorker
i don't want to talk to you
i mean
 i can think of plenty better reasons why i shouldn't date him than the fact that we're semi-related
 i don't think a better reason exists than that one
you are really turning it into something that it's not
 the key word here is "semi"
 the key word here is " "
 that really sucks
 so she wouldn't even blow you
 after all that
nope
did she at least finish putting up those shelves in your closet
what kind of trains are those
they're called the path
 they go to places like new jersey
 pennsylvania and long island

it's like the jews being kosher
 it's the price you pay for being chosen
randy won't stop coming on my face

i mean
 if you enjoy drinking all night and having random sex
 you'll like living in new york
 here's the problem
 they don't wan't a baby with a huge head compared to his chest
 nor do they want to see gross veins all over its chest
 they want the fucking gerber baby
all babies look great in black
 did you know that
actually
 now that they've started talking
 the twins are much less creepy
i love you baby
 but i just can't be looking at your face everyday like that

 now that he's dead
 he gets mail every day

well
 what did you think of the show
it was different
 better than going back to hoboken and falling asleep on my couch
everyone who has ever worked there has come back and robbed the place
if it is that bad
 you should call the better business bureau
all the owner does is comp her friends
 do coke in the back
 and think she is successful
so she got really mad at me when i was trying to break up with her
 she was like "you're breaking up with me cause you like me too much
" and i was like "ya

 never
 but i really want babies
 so i guess i'm just going to have a bastard
you know
 when i found out precum could get you pregnant
 i was so shocked that i hadn't been pregnant
so if you could think about that idea 
and then it exploded and there was semen all over the road
 my problem is that i just can't pay attention for long enough to do my homework the right way
 i mean
 maybe it's's just the weed talking
 but i'd like to see someone
the sex was better because we were both conscious this time
i have this friend

 i'm in between
you be the president

 that can't be a real word
it's like
 silent onomatopoeia
there's no such thing as silent onomatopoeia

i'm scared that i'm going to wake up one morning and be a lesbian
jesus
 we're in public
i was down in tijuana getting some dental work done

 best sleep i ever had
 they should sedate me more often
i couldn't agree more
 this museum is mainly to do with art
i'm going to kill you

trust me; it's good for you
 i mean
 look at these people
have you ever seen them fat
does anyone have purell
purell
 anyone
there's a bathroom right there
i want to my hands
the problem
 james

who are you
you know it's funny i like to date and have sex with black and italian men
 but i can't eat dark meat
 really
 that is weird
look
 honey
 here were are in wonderful central park
really
 i thought it was supposed to be bigger than this
well

can anyone
 for extra credit
 give me two words to describe this day that will go down in history
i'll give you a clue -- it has to do with president bush
"mission accomplished
mission impossible 
 what does tom cruise have to do with bush
yeah
 i know
 that movie isn't even out yet
later mr

 alex

so are you doing anything for cinco de mayo
 i guess i'll just go out like regular
yeah
 that's cool
actually
 one of my friends knows a ton of puerto rican people
 so that'll be good
yeah
you're not my type
what do you mean
first of all
 you're short
 second of all
 you're selling cds on the sidewalk
you see where those turnstiles are
 you're going to make a left there
of course i can't see where the turnstiles are
you know what
 i wish i was a bird
so you could fly far
 far away
 so i could sit on electrical fences and not get shocked
what are we doing here
well
 i'm glad the kids are still asking all the right existential questions
you can't have that dog in here
but he's a service dog
what
 we'll get a ticket if you have a dog in here
he's a service dog
 he's just like a seeing eye dog
what is he
 a chihuahua
 a poodle
 he's not a seeing eye dog
he's a pomeranian
 and he's a service dog
 he even has a little vest
 do you need me to put him in his little vest
he look like a rat with a wig on
he's a service dog
 you can't make me leave
 he's just like a seeing eye dog
but you're not blind
i could sue you if you make me leave
 i'll put him in his little vest
 then you'll see
so my buddy max was telling he how how he hooked up with this puerto rican chick the other night and it was
and it was the best sex he ever had
 right

i think i have malaria
i really don't think you do
do people get malaria in nicaragua
i don't know
 i don't care
 and furthermore
 we were in brazil
why are hipster chicks so unattractive

 i mean
 alex had blue eyes
 you know
 blue eyes
 there just weren't any
what was that word you just said

 there wasn't any of that
the african continent is just with jewish people

to answer your question
 yes
 i had a good time last night
 i enjoyed being picked up and spun around
 i didn't like the cigarette burns on my arm
 but other than that
 i had a good time
i don't know if i blacked out
 i forget
i mean
 you guys were drinking when i went to bed
 you were still drinking when i woke up
 when i went to school you were still drinking
 and you were still drinking when i was at work
the evening would have ended fine had he not shat on her floor

 i've got a coalition of the willing
 son
 and with the help of the lord we're going to abu ghraib all over your face
so he screamed "aaah

" and fell over
 and then i woke up

it was
 like
 8:30 in the morning and my colon called and said it needed a filling
i'm starting to feel like a democrat
 they just forgot about me

just what i would have done
 bro

 right
 you know what it means when someone has a learning disability
i should get myself a lawyer
 no one ever tells me anything
 she was sooo busted

this isn't ice tea
right
 there's no ice in it
 the difference between ice tea and tea is that ice tea is cold
this is cold
then it's ice tea
but that's not the difference
that's unsweetened ice tea
then it's tea
but look how easy it is to pick out the tourists
 i mean
 look
 there's a tourist
 there's a tourist
 it's so frickin' easy to tell who belongs here and who doesn't
yeah
 like why don't they even try to blend in while they're here
 it's like they're trying to be greek when they're in rome
you know
 'cause when you're in rome
 you're supposed to act roman
 i've never been to italy
no honey
 don't touch that
yeah
 that's what killed grandma

this girl i used to work with wore too much eyeliner -- she was from the midwest
 she has a smile only a horse could love
 skips around with lots of boyfriends
 threw a birthday party for her dog -- you get the picture
 so she's an ugly midwestern girl who works at goldman sachs in the muni department
 it's not even real banking
i can't imagine sleeping with any of my male friends
you just need to ignore personality
sometimes i wanna kill your cat
but i thought you hated dogs
i do
 but your cat always looks at me like it wants to hump my leg
so that new girl is pretty hot
i'd like to kiss her vagina
 closed mouth 'cause i'm respectful like that
 that's cheap
that ain't cheap for my trojans
 i mean that's cheap
 like
 on sale
don't be puttin' no bad vibe on my condoms
you know he can't feel that
 right
 he's wearing a leather jacket
what
yeah
 that's why motorcyclists wear leather
 so they don't get their skin scraped off when they go sliding across the pavement
 so if i punch a cow
 it can't feel it

" i said
 "but what am i recovering 
" and he just said
 "don't worry about it

 you can take the ho out of the bronx but you can't take bronx out of the ho

so what
 it's not like you're a rapist or anything
 it's not like you had sex with a little girl
 right
 who's fubu
that's the guy's name
 son
it was a term of endearment
a term of endearment is not punching someone in the face
fao schwarz used to be a fun place to hang out
yeah
they've changed it
 though

my eye won't stop twitching
maybe you should have thought of that before you wiped sarin on the counter

 but
 i'm just curious

okay
 so how many of the people here do you think have noticed that we're high
mmmm
 five of them
there are only five people in the store
then
 all of them
 yes
what happened
never mind
 mom
 you just wouldn't understand
oh my gawd
 that guy just dropped his ipod under the train
he's not even crying
he must be in shock
 i would be
oh shit
 nigga
 i guess your ass got off the island
 huh
i knew it
have a happy father's day
happy father's day to you
 too
 oh no
 not me
 well
 maybe in saigon
 i figured out what happened
 ebony was at the drug house with the first lesbian
 but then that other lesbian that she stole two dollars from came
 so that's where you came in
 and
 are you there
 mom
 mom
well
 what do you really want out of life
besides hardcore sadomasochistic sex
people are totally listening to this conversation
 they're really not
i can't believe that cvs didn't have paint
 how about bagel art
 that place should have paint
that says bagel mart
 it doesn't
move a little to your left
bagel
mart
 so then what does it have
how much does he want
ten dollars
fuck you
 i'd rather drag my friend home on her face than pay you ten dollars
oh lord
 satan's children are walking the streets
shut the fuck up
 rosa parks
 go sit in the back of the fucking bus
will you take $20 for that bag
twenty
 you've got nerve
 i'll pray for you
pray that someone is stupid enough to pay more than twenty bucks for that plastic piece of shit
this car is stolen
what the fuck you talking about
i got a stolencarreport on my phone about this car being stolen
muthafucka
 you about to get your phone stolen
i've been in this neighborhood for so long
mhh-hmmmh
oh man
 see that brownstone
 ago i was invited to a wedding reception there
 it was awesome
 beautiful
 i was sitting right up front and laughing and crying with the rest of the family
 like
 i love you ladies
 damn
 to this day
 i still don't know how the hell i got there
 or who those bitches were
the yogurt won't fall
 i'm straight
you are straight
i am straight
 now
thank god that's over
let's get out of here before the whole thing collapses
i wish that dad was here
i do too
 because the fat fuck owes me a thousand dollars
lindsay
 we need you right away
oh my god
 don't talk to me like i'm some kind of normal person
i hear people in third world countries are so hungry they eat people
i know
 i wonder
 like
 whether they have a conscience about it
well
 i imagine they don't eat their own children
 you know
 probably just someone else's
 it would be easier to do that
 i think
yeah
 i totally agree
 snowflakes
wanna drink some nigga juice tonight
are you sure you feel safe walking back by yourself
yeah
 i usually don't get harassed this much
 i think it's just because there are two of us
so it's exponential
exactly
 right now
 we're whiteness
 squared
but you're 15
 that's 5 years
 you'd be like a pedophile
it's not like i'm looking for a relationship
 i just wanna bone
i need to bring you to church
 you need every kind of religion there is
mommy
mommmmmyyyyyy
 i have got to poop
would you please just crap in your pants and quit screaming about it already
let me ask you something: a lady sits down next to you on the train and you keep inching towards me
 why
 when a lady sits down
 you inch towards her
 not me
 why are you inchin' towards me
 what's wrong with new yorkers
 all scared of women
but you don't wear underwear
 and you were wearing a see-through top
 that's totally not the point
i don't know if my sister is a lesbian or not
i thought she was
yeah
 but the other day some guy was like
 oh yeah
 your sister dated nick for a long time
 and now all i know is that she's dating someone who makes omelettes
 omelettes are manly
 right
why do you watch so much king of the hill 
 anyway
i don't know
 i guess i just like texas history
to all the men on the train
 happy father's day
 and to all the ladies on the train who wear two hats
 happy father's day to you
 too
taco bell is fifty cents
 but i don't want to go to taco bell for a date
have you noticed that if you say "taco bell" enough
 it starts to sound funny
taco bell
taco bell
 it sounds like a battle of the civil war
the battle of taco bell
wait
 where are we
fuckin' earth man
 fucking earth
wait
 where
what are we doing here
looking at handsome gay guys
because they're more fun than straight guys
 and they like it when you look at them
so did you ask your mom if you can go to the party or not
oh yeah
 she said yes
 but she made me promise to not come home this time with no pants on
seems fair
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
 and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee
are you trying to mug me or what
ma'am
 could you please move your bag so i could sit down
 can't you see i'm busy
 bitch
 and i'm not movin this fuckin' thing
 it's heavy and i don't want to pick it up again
 sit somewhere else
the key to divine love and inner peace 
i was just at the spot and there was no car
 fuck
 i know what a car looks like and it wasn't there
 are you sure it was a white lexus
 fuck you
 it wasn't there
 i got eyes
 you know
 well then fuck off and go buy your own damn drugs
is it disgusting that i think pregnant women are sexy
not necessarily
like that woman there
 that round belly makes me want to come all over her face
okay
 that is disgusting
so when i started telling him my feelings on the iraq war
 he rolled over to me in his wheelchair and started cursing me out
 he was going on about his time in vietnam and how there are things about war i'll never understand
that sucks
i was like
 "whoa
 you're my shrink
 i'm paying to listen to 
seriously
well
 at least the co-pay was only $15
 but anyway
 i'm definitely not going back to him
is there a specific exhibit you'd like to see
yeah
 i want to see the dinosaurs
there are many africans where i live
 i like them
 because they're more spiritual
they're closer to nature
omgosh
 let's go watch the world cup
 like
 we'll see witchcraft
magic
stuff
oh yeah
 totally
 that stuff from harry potter
but also chuck norris
well
 that's a given
i know
 i just like saying his name
gives you a little rush
you don't know the half of it
is it true that mexicans carry knives
shut up before i bust into a stereotype on your ass
 can i jump off and be naaaaaaacho
you already broke your arm
 you can't be nacho right now
you have to just ask him
 but you have to ask him to his face so you can see his reaction
 just look him in the eye and say
 "dad
 are you on match
" and see if he looks surprised
 you just have to confront stuff like that
it doesn't mean anything
 it's just green paper
 it doesn't mean anything
then why don't you throw it out
fine
 [throws bill onto subway tracks] if it means so much to you
 why don't you go get it
 that was five-dollar bill
for reals
 it's gone
where's my money
 it's so great to run into you
 i haven't heard from you in so long
yeah
 that's because you didn't call me after we slept together
maybe a tattoo
 we should get tattoos
i find those people
 them
 to be low class
but we are low class
touche
you look like vanna white
really
don't she look like vanna white
 but better
what do you mean better
 vanna is rich and shit
 and on tv
 and this bitch over here has nothing
 she's on the subway
 for christ's sake
what's he wear now
he's completely switched
 now he likes to wear button-down shirts with cufflinks
that probably looks much better
 his face is way too brown to be goth
is this the way to the subway
 you need to go west of 49th
can i go down there anyway
 there's a special event
please
 we're from california
 welcome to new york
so it's my beer pong table
 right
 if we ever break up
 i get the table
well
 half of it
 if you're going to cut it in half
 you can have it
 i don't want to see the table ruined
 i care about beer pong that much
 it's like the judgment of solomon
you guys know what herpes are
herpes are what you get from whorehouses
 they look like
you know pretzel sticks with salt
i haven't seen that guy with the toupee on the train since i said something
do you think he heard you
maybe
 maybe he committed suicide
that's $1
you're killing me
 man
 hey
 do you know if the liquor store's still open
you don't
ex-see-cus-see me
ex-see-cus-see me
 what are you excusing me about
 fuck you
fuck me
 take-a off the pant
ex-see-cus-see me
sure thing
 ma'am
 i'm sorry
and that's why we respect our elders
you never wear earrings
you're very observant
but that's why we have ears
 to get them pierced
 we have ears so we can hear
wait
 you make no sense
hey there
 mister
is he serious
i don't know
 what do we do
smile
 folks
 it's a joke
 i need a whole six-pack
a-rod's so hot
 do you see the lips on him
 jeter's so hot
 tino was the hottest of them all
 even that knoblauch was cute
 remember him
 hell
 i'd sleep with any of the yankees
 but you know
 i'd draw the line at yogi berra
 is there anything wrong with you
 do you have horns
a third arm
nope
have you ever been in jail
nope
well
 you know
 i've been in jail
you as an individual have to decide what is right for you as an individual
you have to decide as an individual whether or not you want to turn yourself in
i don't know
 she stop right in front of me
she just slammed on the brakes
 why did she do that
i don't know
 light was yellow
 you know
 green is go
 red is stop
 yellow is go faster
sure
 absolutely
gross man
 you eating white castle
 nasty
yeah girl
 these is good
 i love them
guess you won't be loving them when the next time you take a shit
 your liver comes out too
 why you hatin' on white castle
you'll see
so how do i get that pre-freshman to give me a handjob
do you realize that you're graduating from college soon
 and you're asking me this
you cut in front of him because he's black
i did not
 i just didn't see him
you didn't see him because he's too black
so i got some of that topical headache medicine
 you know
 the cream that comes in a giant chapstick tube so you just rub it on your head without getting it on your hands
 well
 i don't know if it worked
 i got so much of it in my eyes that i had to spend the rest of the night in the emergency room
mommy
 let's go in that one
no honey
 that one is for boys
 you can't go in there until you're 25 and at a bar and you really have to go
--panorama
 85th and 2nd
damn
 that mexican is hungry
i'm the delivery boy
 you dumb fuck
and to make matters worse
 she stole my bag of weed
she told you she had herpes
 and you're worried about your weed
i can't believe they're making a live action movie
whatever
 i will definitely go see it
are you even old enough to remember 
of course
 i'm only three years younger than you
yeah
 but that doesn't mean you were old enough to be conscious of 
 my brothers are your age and they don't remember the show that well
you do realize every time you ask me that it doesn't make me seem young
 right
 it just makes you seem old
where are you from
we're from texas
 why
 could you hear our accents over there
 it's because in new york we know that you can't bring dogs into restaurants
you can't
 you can't
 we work for the department of public health
 consider this a warning
 i thought it was ok because y'all are ok with paris hilton and all
you see
 you almost hit that nice lady
 then she would have sued you and took all your playstation games
 cyrus
 don't touch that
 you have ringworm
 that looks like metallic vagina sculpture
i would like to see something a little bit more modern
 this isn't modern enough for me
too much papaya
 too much marijuana
 too much cocaine
you're not following the diet plan
 it's either junk food or food
move to the back of the bus
 they're giving free diamonds in the back of the bus
 see that lady in the back for your free diamond
i hate this city
 you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a production
you know my ex-boyfriend
 right
 come on
 you remember him
 his sister was in jail with amy fisher
stop singing joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat 
 that's all i'll ever ask of you
you know
 i have been so gassy lately
 i found this guy i thought i'd fix you up with
 but i talked to elliot and he said he wouldn't cross the street to piss on him
 he's an ethical scumbag
 yeah
 i that's what everybody says about elliott
my son's favorite color used to be red
 because his father is a blood
 but i've gotten him out of that
 now it's blue
 and his father is going nuts
but why does your mom want to get so many tattoos
i just fell asleep
 it's not like i'm seeing other people
you told me you was a celebrity
 i sucked yo dick
i'm no whore

i'm blacker than the fucking poops you shit
 son

 where'd all these white people come from
you know
 i like to make happy with the pretty girls

 her mother had no idea she has tattoos
i don't see the big deal
 so she has tattoos
 everyone has
wait
 did you say her last name was goldstein
 i get it now
ben's hot
 but i think he's gay
no way
 why
he asked me if my carpet matches my drapes
i don't think he's gay
oh yeah
call him up and tell him he can chew on your carpet
what
yeah
 the kitty pushes the others around
 he's a real tyrant
 uh-huh

damn son
 you ain't gonna live to be my age if you keep goin' around callin' people assholes
shut the fuck up
 old man

 you weren't doing what i was doing all day
 it feels like someone ripped my ass off and stapled it back on
i don't like german shepherds

 she is a little too tall to be mexican
 but i don't care
 i'll still hit it
i'll hit it and help her get her papers if she doesn't have them
 i'm all for amnesty in the name of getting laid
i wanna sleep here
 just because i wanna sleep outside of doc holliday's doesn't make me a bad person
i wanna sleep here

try walking
what
look
 in new york most people aboveground get where they're going by walking
 the sidewalks are the main roads in the city
if you were driving on a busy road
 you wouldn't just stop or take random turns in traffic without checking your mirrors or signaling
 right
how do i signal
ya know
 it's the smart people not having kids
 or maybe having one or two
 its the uneducated that are reproducing more uneducated people
 you know that 64% of kids born today are minority
 we should build that fence bewteen us and mexico
in class i start saying "african american" and then i'm like
 fuck it
 and i say "black black black
" i don't have time to be saying "african american
you can only really pull off a fu man chu if you're a cop
 a gay porn star
 or a pirate
ladies and gentlemen
 we apologize for the delay
 i promise it will never
 happen

 to be honest
they drive it through the city in milk trucks so that no one will know

 it was going to leave a mark
my father was telling me the dangers of aspartame -- you know the stuff in diet coke
 it's like a sugar
 it was once registered as a chemical weapon
yeah
if there is any way to become a superhero
 it has to be by drinking diet coke
i can't remember how it ends
 if he dies in a war or if gatsby gets in a car crash
 but he loves daisy
pasties are band-aids that only cover your nipples
it feels like it's raining
i think it's coming from the set

 i think it will be a really nice experience for me
mmhmm
 i'm serious
 i love jews
 and like
 i'm not just saying it to get into your pants
he probably met her in darfur
yeah

 they probably met in college
are you kidding me
what
darfur is not a college
 it's a country
 it's a college
 it's a country in africa
she's right
 it's a country in africa
 i thought we were talking about the college darfur
right
well
 christy works with three people who are getting sex changes
yeah
 but she works at a vegan restaurant
you're sitting on my dress
 i'm so sorry
do you enjoy sitting on women
well
 it depends on how old they are
i wish they had a whole pizza made of crust
 i would so buy it
 too
you mean bread
the freshman at stuyvesant are more attractive than the sophomores this year
that's because they lowered the standards for them last year
 and dumber people are obviously way hotter than smarter ones
watches -- five dollars
five dollars
 what's the catch
they'll never catch me
 why did newsboys used to shout "extra
" when they'd sell papers
i don't know
 maybe the news was about
 like
 x-men
 like
 mutants
yeah
 true
 maybe
 i don't even want to think about it
 cunnilingus
of course you think it's gross if you call it that
it's just latin
it's vulgar latin
 you got the boys gone crazy 
yeah man
 girls gone crazy
 whatever
 it'll do
so you think you can get me financing for the car
 i could get a horse thief financing
so the guy actually steals horses
 where do you meet these people
i haven't had a regular check up in years
 but i've had about five mris
 there's a lot going on in my head
yeah
 everything but a full head of hair
so they're like
 not gonna let me graduate
what if you give them money
 my school's a capitalist machine
 they'll let you get away with murder if you pay them enough
unless you're pregnant
 then you're screwed
 they're too used to kids pulling knives on them for extra pencils
then cry
 you can get anything you want by crying
 works for me
 can i borrow your nirvana cd to burn
 my ipod erased my mp3s
i wish i had it
 i like
 traded it away for a pack of cigarettes
woah
 that's so
 kurt cobain of you
hello
 totally why i did it
are you a millionaire
 my parents are in the polish mafia
i's a-gonna buy dis pickle
 it's been six months since i hadda pickle
 i don't eat no pickles lately
why not
i dunno
 every time it's like i'm-a suckinacock
i hate customers like you
 with your big bills for a 95-cent drink
i could always shoot your old ass
 and have the soda for free if that makes making change any easier
i wanna have like 15 kids all by the same woman
that's crazy
my grandmother had 16 kids
 that's a real woman
 i want to marry a real woman
 look
 it's her again
who is this lady
 she's everywhere
so what nationality are you
scandinavian
cool
 where is scandinavia
it's just sore gums
 probably from flossing
 no need to worry
but it could get infected
 right
 and i could die
 right
has anyone ever died from this in the history of mankind
 maybe
 but you could also walk out of the hospital and be hit by a bus
 you have a better chance of that happening
so you're saying i could die from this
 and i shouldn't leave the hospital
 i just wanted to let you know i'm just coming out of a relationship
 well
 then i should tell you that i used to be a stripper in chicago
i have herpes
that's ok
 i have two cats
are those real diamonds
awwww i'll mail you some real ones for your bar mitzvah
 okay
if my wife looked like you
 i would stop smoking crack and get a job
thanks
i am able to diagnose psychological issues very accurately because i used to suffer from them myself
 for example
 your typical goth girl will have below-average self-esteem
 girls who dance with their hands above their heads or who are obsessed about their purses date a lot and also suffer from low self-esteem
what did you do this weekend
masturbate
 you
they have bob marley's last burrito -- just like the other place we went to
didn't he only have one last burrito
why would someone tell you that right after meeting you
honestly
 why can't you just say your favorite movie is the lord of the rings instead of lord of the rings porn
i don't think we learned anything
well
 did you do the reading
well
 what did you expect
i don't like to read
 i like to be taught
i can't believe he said that
i can't believe i'm taking a shit in public
get your hand out of my pocket
i wasn't gonna take nothin'
 i just wanted to touch yo ass
our desk chairs suck
i'm happy
and amazingly beautiful
 settle down
 we're going to watch this biography video
it better not be about hitler
what's wrong with hitler
i wish i was anorexic
i'm going to punch you so that your head ricochets against that door
city ballet
 [to dancer guy] city ballet
you would
 you city ballet whore
michael jackson sucks
well
 did you hear his music when he was black
michael jackson was 
eat your vegetables
i'm opposed to vegetables
 your brother is opposed to dating women
 and apparently we're letting that one slide
that's a gorgeous ring
 what is that
 5 carats
 i'm going to give it to my granddaughter when she turns 16
 maybe 18
 as long as i know she's still a virgin
what's that
 mommy
that's what the tourists use to look at us
excuse me
 do you work here
oh good
 is this central park
 this is dale and thomas popcorn
 well the bus guide said this was it
 where is it
just walk that way
well that's not much help
 how the hell am i supposed to find it
oh trust me
 you'll find it
it's a big fucking park
 yes
 i remember him
well i'd hope you'd remember him after he stuck his finger in your butt
i just don't get it
 he said they were just friends
 but they were always hanging out
 then all of a sudden he dumps me
girl friend
 you've been jolie'd
 i'm telling you
 i'm right
 he couldn't eat the trix because he was an rabbit
 and trix were only supposed to be for kids
well
 i always thought it was just because he was a rabbit and not a person
what's wrong
i'm just really getting tired of you always being wrong
jason
 what's your password
i would never want my little girl to be in girl scouts
because girl scouts is for lesbians
that's not true
 i was in girl scouts
 and i'm not a lesbian
yeah
 but you're fat and alone
can anyone spare some change
 please
 i'm homeless and hungry
is that the same bloke from the earlier train
 i think it's a woman
 poor thing
 i wish we had a brassiere to give her
you need a school id
what the hell
 let's sneak in
i've been thrown out of better places than columbia
yeah
 i just moved into a place in bushwick
 i'm the only black guy for
 like
 five miles
 other white hipsters stare at him
what
what's the best way to get puke out of leather
i think you're too old to be asking that question
it was nice to meet you
 now will you shake my hand
why not
because she gave you her number
 but she already has a boyfriend
 i don't like that
shut up
 that's not true
if it isn't
 then why did it say "jason and trish
 together forever" on your phone
 when i turned it on right now
together forever
 my ass; now shut up
 your daddy didn't come out of my vagina
 he was sideways
 so he couldn't come out of my vagina
 his body couldn't fit out of my vagina
my hamptons house is on the cover
actually
 it's not his house anymore
it's my ex-wife's
yeah
 he traded the house for me
stop it
 you can't do that
why not
because this is new york
 people here have more class than you
that girl's not too bad looking
 how old
 you think
 married
 possibly
she looks 26 and pissed off
so she must be married
with kids
that looks like the place to be
 i'm going in that room
dude
 that's a mirror
look at this
 look at all this
 you're in nature
 aren't you having fun
well then there's something wrong with you
 i called you last night
 why you didn't answer
 yeah
 i'm working now
what you doing this weekend
 wanna go fishing
 let's do barbeque
 what
 yeah
 yeah
 man
 let's get some barbeque going
 okay
 i have to work now
 i'll call you later tonight
first i shampoo and then i rinse and then i shampoo and then i rinse and then i condition and then i shampoo and then i condition and then i rinse
the problem is that you're telling your hair what it wants
 you're not asking your hair what it wants
i think tom was kinda weird
yeah
 he was really into nazis
yeah
 there's that
pennies for the poor
 [to girl with scoop bag] oh come on
 you just went shopping
which is why i don't have any money
ya know
 every time i go to a family reunion i discover a new family member i didn't know existed
such as
did you know about grandma
my mother is friends with tons of socialites
well my father fucked madonna
you win
i got 
 x-men iii 
 all high quality
those are illegal
 you're stealing from me
 i'm a writer
what
 did you write any of these
you're selling illegal goods
 i'm a writer
 you're stealing from me
if you wrote any of these movies
 you wouldn't be riding the subway
 what's the third state in the tri-state area
 i know: new jersey
certainly new york
 is it connecticut
you never hear about a bi-state area
what about nicaragua
 didn't you have sex with both a girl and a boy there
i don't think the country of nicaragua bases its sense of identity on my sexual exploits
is long island a state
enjoy your party
 everyone here loves you
everyone here loves alcohol
better
what's that really fast train called
anthrax
 that's allergy medicine
i think elvis died on my birthday
 wait
 elvis died on madonna's birthday
 why do i always get that confused
dudes
 we are staying at the bellagio
 that gives us instant credibility
but he didn't get shot
 the old man's dead
 niiiice
mommy
 mommy
 guess what i dreamt about last night
 i dreamt i was dead
well
 i'd rather do it for a dead person than a handicapped one
i don't want you to freak out about this
 man
 but when i die i want you by my side
i have to sleep with her before she gets married
it's 
 not racism
i want the wedding without the husband
 really
 i want to wear the dress and have a party all about me
so she said
 "don't you want to marry me
" and i was like [shrugging]
 "why the fuck not
i can't believe you can't spend three hours to come to my wedding so you can study for the bar exam
 i'm your sister
 and this is my first wedding
 so it's really important to me
if i had known how much work marriage was gonna be
 i would've said
 "fuck the cow
 give me the milk for free
well
 they're past the murder-suicide part of their marriage
 so that's good
hold on to the pole
 honey
 but keep your tongue away from it
 it's filthy
 jake
 don't eat the watch
time flies
 but it doesn't taste good
take your muffin outta the box
 if it goes through the machine
 it'll give you radiation
yeah yeah
 life's a disappointment
walk or die
 walk or die
 walk or die
you're always tan
everyone wants to be tan
what
 what do you mean
 what do you mean your audition is gonna be in a bathroom
and a urinal cake is worth fifteen points
sex just isn't the same when you're constipated
so i just said to him
 "bye
 i have to go now
 i have diarrhea
diarrhea is like the anti-aphrodisiac
did you just say that you had a dream where gene wilder peed in your closet
 like
 willy wonka
 pissing on your clothes
 okay
 i just wanted to make sure i heard correctly
 i wouldn't piss on someone if i didn't know them
oh come on
 you fucking cunt
 work the damn door
 big fucking place like this
 they got only one bathroom
 i am fucking pissing on the floor
 i will piss on the damn floor
 that's my fucking right as an american
 i'm a patriot
 patriot
 that's an adverb
 an adverb
 mrs
 riegell told me in third grade if you have a syllable you've got an adverb
 and i got a damn syllable
 so damnit
 i'm pissing on the fucking floor
will i accept payment in what
 in coke
 fuck no
 i won't accept an eight-ball as payment
 no way
 bitch
 i don't care how pure it is
 uh-uh
 the only coke i do comes in five dollar rocks
 i can't afford to get hooked on that expensive shit
the reason i'm buying all of this coke is so that we can fuck
can you imagine saying your vows when you're that coked up
oh my god
 she took a picture of me one time while i was doing a line
 and i was
 like
 so pissed
america runs on cocaine
i just want to buy some fucking groceries so we don't spend all our money on coke
all we're gonna do anyway is drink in my basement
 fuckin' suburbia
and he was like
 "you people from connecticut
 all you ever do is drink cocktails and text-message each other
it's like
like the herbal tea of beers
dude
 you can't get married
 you're going to college
 there's gonna be a lot of girls and beer
 every day 
what do you mean she's not drunk yet
we're going to strap the beer to the dog
 and go down to the ho chi minh trail
 and camp out by the railroad tracks
i would rather be poor and not famous than famous and poor
i drank a lot today
 but i am not drunk
did you do her
mazel tov
was she drunk
okay
 here's the plan: we paint your van
 then you have sex with susan
 then i'll have sex with
someone else
 then we both smoke a of weed
 i just stopped smoking weed
 cause
 like
 i heard it was bad for you
 so i started smoking cigarettes again
 i'm not
 i told you i quit
 [exhales] umm
 that was just me blowing my bangs out of my eyes
i read somewhere that if you quit smoking by the time you are middle aged your body can still recover
 and i thought
 "great i still have a couple more years to quit
" then i read what they define "middle aged" as
 i'm 
 you cannot smell my armpit
look
 having knees doesn't make you special
when she's asleep
 i'm gonna squat on her brain
did your brain fall out
his teeth are really straight
 but that's because he was home-schooled
every time a girl sees my teeth
 she's like
 "naaah
" i'm gonna get this whole shit redone
 where they take them all out and replace the whole thing
 it costs like $20
only thing is you have to go two months without any teeth
excuse me
 miss
 you have very nice legs
 have you ever thought about doing voice-overs
who wants to play guess which body part am i fidgeting
so when you said you loved her
 did you say you loved her booty
your mama's booty is gonna come in handy tonight
 you know i want tarzan the musical to be a giant flop
 but
maybe these crackers be famous
 but it's broadway
 this shit sucks
on wednesday
 we're going to see the directors the directors the directors 
 c'mon
 you know
 the directors 
 i mean the producers 
that's a real cute phone for a nigger without a job
i dunno
 if i had that much money
 i'd spend it on something else
 like pants made of diamonds
or hookers made of gold
you're a fucking moron
 kid
 wasting all your money on that shit
 like
 if you know anyone who
 like
 needs
 like
 anyone to do
 like
 anything for money
 i'm totally desperate
 for sure
 i'll totally let you know
 he was pissed
 she swallowed his cousin's babies
 but she wouldn't swallow his
that ain't true love
all right
 people
 there is six hundred feet of train
 let's try to use more than one door
 please
well that was rude
we were trying to name all fifty states
 and i was like
 "is delaware a state
" and then three other people asked the same thing
maybe i'll take you to lucky cheng's
i thought you'd heard of it
 see
 men dress up as women there
 they're called transvestites
 some of them even have had surgery
 i won't really take you there
 i just wanted to understand your thought process
 see how you react when i throw something like that out there
what
 are you taking me there
so i was watching this thing on tv about nelson mandela
i don't remember him
he's famous
oh yeah
 didn't he used to be a host on mtv
so i think i lost my favorite jeans
what jeans
you know
 the ones that make my ass look small
honey
 you can't lose something that doesn't exist
 aren't you david copperfield
will you do a trick
not tonight
 sorry
you must have pulled something out of a hat to get in here
 loser
i think that's just so ridiculous that they would expect you to teach these kids when you don't know the kids at all
well they had name tags
did you see that italian lady offer me her seat on the subway
yeah
 it's the shirt
 this fucking expensive shirt makes me look pregnant
so don't wear it anymore
 it was expensive
 i'd rather look like a well-dressed
 knocked-up slut than a single girl with sub-par taste in clothing
i find it tart
 too
 also kind of musky and a little sweet
 wait
 are you talking about pineapple or pussy
--washington heights
'scuse me
 sir
 can you tell me how to get to baltimore
damn
 --times square
i think it is better to be born with no legs than to be born with two and have them taken away
she think she know everything
 if he love her so much
 why'd he go get that other girl pregnant two months after she lost her leg
 he should be giving a baby
it doesn't matter how many people i've had sex with
if i can remember each of their names
 then it isn't a lot
you had a threesome with the mayor of 
pear applesauce
 strawberry applesauce
 banana applesauce
 god
 it's like the apples did every other fruit in the garden
and after the party
 everyone gets innoculated and takes the morning after pill
the problem is that men are paradoxically both a reason to be celibate and to have large amounts of sex
my sister had a kidney removed when she was 9
 and she still uses it
yeah
 the only reason i have kids is that
 if i ever need it
 i know there's a compatible kidney around
if i wanted to be angry
 i would have punched you in the face a long time ago
sometimes the most spiritual fucking thing to do is punch somebody in the face
it's not like someone put a gun to your head and told you to fuck her
 i'm interested in your sparring class
 you see i want to hit somebody
 i don't care if you a girl or not
 i will bust you in the head with a rock
then he peer-pressured me into being morbidly obese
nothing's bigger than oprah
 not even my mother's ass
new york sports club
 only 37 dollars
 get yo' fat ass to the gym
mommy
 i'm sick of all the fat girls in coney island
it's not cheating if she's fat
 great
 now she's just going to make fun of me because i'm short and fat
 oh my god
 i guess she must really like that swan
she was real "helen of troy" pussy
i don't know
 thinking about going to the movies
 maybe i'll see the devil in miss prada 
yeah i sold my soul to the devil
 i was like
 "hey
 devil
 can i sell you my soul
" and he was like
 "okay
 futhermore
 we all know that the devil does not wear prada
 he wears flame-retardant knock-offs from target
and then the tourists paused near the construction of the new york times' new building
 and one
 who was i guess their leader
 pointed to it and said
 "everyone
 that's ground zero
and this is h street
 so we'll be in soho next
 look
 i think that's times square
 i can't
 i'm in the times square area right now
excuse me
 is this times square
does this train go to manhattan
wait
 are we in manhattan or just new york
could you tell me how to get back to manhattan
fuck you
 you shithead
 ya goddamn farthole
and i'm just gonna take a shit in his fucking mouth
shit already
 damnit
 do you hear me
 shit already
look a mongoloid mongolian
well
 she wasn't a better person before she went to rehab
 just a more fun one
yeah
 i agree
 it would be awesome if she relapsed
 god
 we are terrible people
i really never cared for skiing
 but i was so alone in my marriage
 i found it was a great way to meet men
 want to go to a ballroom club
game of chess
 play chess
 chess
also got chronic
and they kept talking shit about gay people
fucking bigots
 those people should be lynched
 i told you to stop talking about lynching in this neighborhood
my ex was such a wuss
 he even sucked his thumb
 thirty years old and he sucked his fucking thumb
yeah
 my ex had a little pillow on his bed that said
 "princess sleeps here
didn't buy that for him
 let's already
if you're so bored
 go play in traffic
yeah
 tell that bitch i'm crazy
 i'm mad crazy
 not that crazy on the train shit
 i'm crazy goin' ta' jail shit
but he's so funny when he's not having seizures
that's why i ejaculated in your mom's nose
 i don't like the idea of drinking semen not directly from the cock
he took me to a japanese restaurant
 i got the chicken karaoke
 is alabama kentucky
the himalayas aren't a real place
 they're like narnia
in british whose line is it anyway
 do they speak english
my doctor told me if you piss right after sex
 you can't get stds
yeah
 i do it all the time
wait
 you had a dream that you had aids
 that had aids
 fuck you
 man
i know it's sick
 but i'm so excited that i can have unsafe sex now
excuse me
 i don't know if this is a trans-generational or new york metropolitan faux pas 
 but you should really tell your friend
 girlfriend
 lady friend or whatever that one in every four persons in america has herpes
we have to make out tonight
 and we have to get it on camera
i felt so uncomfortable so
 like
 i had to get wasted
my parents just don't know me anymore
 you know
 i've changed my last year in new york
 you know
 like
 i've had sex with a lot of people
yeah
 but you have to bring a leather outfit
 otherwise you won't get any clients
 everyone there is a biker or otherwise they are latex fetishists
i used to have two vibrators
 but i broke 'em both
yeah
 so long islanders will be there
 you know what that means: debauchery
and danger
he had the nerve to tell me that i had no life
 i was like
 "i do too have a life
 i am drinking constantly
 jane*
 in case i get thrown in jail tonight you have the money for bail
 right
they said i'd be looking at a $10
000 fine and six months in jail
 but they didn't take my name
 i figure if people aren't out wandering the streets looking for me
 i'm okay
that's so cute
 but did he really just get out of jail
they're fuckin' cowards
 man
 mountain lions are cowards
 too
well don't ask me
 i don't know anything about the mechanics of whale sex
please enter the train as human beings
 not wild animals
yeah that reminds me of my first time
 he took me to dinner but was too nice and perfect
 then in bed he made animal noises and his cat was like between us and he didn't kick it out of bed
so i woke up with a slice of pizza on my stomach again last night
you know my theory: ground beef makes anything taste better
give me a donut
 but not a very sweet one

 when i was depressed
 a friend of mine took all my drugs
 then i went to her place
 and i said
 "hey

" so she gives me this one bottle
 and later i go in her bathroom
 and i look in the medicine cabinet
 and they're all right there
 i mean
 why would she leave them there
 she had to know i'd just go in there and take them back
and later i went to a party--you know
 that rooftop party--and someone stole all my oxycontin
i was just kidding
 i've had a stressful day
i really wish we had stayed
 i totally would have waited in the rain and gotten wet for beyonc&eacute;
i didn't know you were into chicks
wet from the rain
 you jackass
 that guy was queerer than a football bat
 --40th & 6th
my son can play football

i mean
 when you think about it
 he's really just a big vagina with sand in it

i am so not letting my underwear go on a date with his underwear
where were you last night at 3 a

making big macs is complex
 it's 2 all-beef patties
 special sauce
 lettuce
 cheese
 pickles
 onions
 on a sesame seed bun
and then it gets even more confusing
 'cause people all have their special requests
 like no special sauce
 and that just throws shit off
 the whopper is so easy
 it don't have shit on us
i said
 " quiero taco bell 
how much to go to k
carla is going to be there

 that's so cute
we should take a picture with it
i just met my first rude person in this city
so my fingers are covered with little box-cutter cuts
 which means i can't go shoving them into the places that i used to
 now i might catch something
yeah
 i was only able to throw up breakfast and lunch today
damn
 i hate when that happens
i bet she had a frontal lobotomy
really
 i was thinking she might be slightly autistic
maybe she's just really happy
so the subway in abu dhabi is pretty convenient
yeah
 but the only thing i don't understand is how they can put a subway on an island
think about it
i've never figured out all those different deodorant smells
 why do you need deodorant with different smells
well
 maybe someday you'll have a boyfriend you'll want to impress
by having fruity armpits
you never know
 he might want to smell them
i had beer for breakfast this morning
 beer and cheese fries
 and she had 'em with me

you've had way too much cock in your mouth to be vegan
it ain't natural
 our bodies
 they have the to digest meat
 if we were like a goat--and not to insult you
 miss
 'cause you're prettier than a goat--but then that's okay that we don't eat meat
 but we ain't
 we're carnivores
 if you're a vegetarian
 you gotta listen to your body
 it's tellin' you: " meat me 
" you know
 like
 " meat me 
i want to have sex
 i'm old enough
ya know
 something tells me my wife hasn't even been born yet

 i got fired at barely legal
 i got tired of playing twister in my pajamas
nothing says new york like a wire frog
it's people like that who give new york city a bad name
of course i have a snarky attitude
 i'm a new yorker; it's practically a requirement
yeah
 i'm in new york
 yeah
 it's kinda like new orleans
 except bigger and you can't drink in the streets
new york is about freedom
 suck a dick
 that's why i never leave new york
 you never see crazy motherfuckers like that in new york
except for niggas on the train
there's a of people in this new york city
where's susan smith when you need her
 i can't babysit them
 mom

 i wasn't sure if i was going to love you
 you're not going to remember that

she know she got a man
 but she'll still gimme some
 she know that
i dare you to fuck someone else again
 i dare you
 you better not fuck anyone else

since when has your gaping hole decided to be faithful to your boyfriend
when i first met you seven months ago i was kinda in another relationship
 but now that that's over
 wanna get back in bed
so i'm fucking his wife for 6 years
 and he complains
if the power goes out and we lose the air conditioning
 we can always use the fans
am i keeping it real
 i'm wearing a goddamn blazer
 and it's 100 degrees out
 of course i'm keeping it real
 i know it's real hot out there
 so this is what i do when i'm walking down the streets of new york and trying to keep cool
 i just sing this little song to myself: "i'm dreaming of a white christmas
 just like the ones i used to know"
all right
 you all
 this is 68th street
 keep cool out there
it's too hot for stupidness
you think this is hot
 is hot
how you been doing in this heatwave
that's hot
well
 now i'm getting all hot
 thinking of my hot
 sweaty cousin
frankly
 the only reason i'm going in to work today is because they have better air conditioning than i do
the only things i look forward to in life are mayonnaise and sex
when sex turns into math
 you've got trouble on your hands
what a bitch
 i swear
 it's getting harder and harder to fuck your co-worker and get away without people finding out
well you can't expect every guy you sleep with to call you back
 basically
 you sleep with people out of hilarity
 i told her i'd rather have sex with my husband than buy her products
 and then she hung up on me
yo estoy borracha
 yo estoy borracha
 yo estoy borracha

 the olympian
 the firefighter
 the soldier
 maybe tonight i can add the hipster

 and they're on their bikes
 i'm like

i can't believe it
 i just can't believe i'm being charged in connection with this crime
 i mean the one--she's the one who committed manslaughter
you know
 we haven't gotten robbed in a while
 i can't believe it
if i had anything to say him it would be this: prison is going to be hard on you because fraud is a crime
i'm just glad to be off the fbi's most wanted list
guess who i interviewed today
 this guy got sent to jail twice for sodomy
i had to call him back after i read that
but at least he's not
 like
 a thief or something
 i bet those two tear drops were for the guys he fucked
it wouldn't look good on your job application if you got arrested
i understand that
 but you know it's not really about being a good guy or being a bad guy
 it's about you taking that nice woman's wallet
she had sex with a dragon
 she had sex with a

 you see how quickly that escalated
 all because of courtesy
 that guy couldn't even apologize

 and i can't stand to be alone with my own thoughts
i could respect someone with that ring tone

 there's no answer
 she must be whipping now
i like it when he hits me
 you know
 i hit him just so he could hit me back
 i like it rough
she just told me a story about someone waking up with a dildo in her mouth
 you need to meet this girl

myspace is like crack
 i'm addicted to that shit
google is
 like
 totally taking over the world

 a slutty web-designer friend we can bring in on this
i should just bring her a bunch of photos of my ex-girlfriend and slam them down and be like

me and jesus don't get along
 like
 our periods stopped at the same time for two hours so we could have sex and i was like
 god loves me
 jesus was clearly gay
yeah

 and she's ugly
 it's one thing to be a bitch
 but to be one when you're ugly
 you just don't do that
i don't know what i'd do if i had a kid and it was ugly
 i'd probably die of embarassment or something
 maybe i should adopt
 can you

we will be dimming the cabin lighting
 as it greatly improves the attractiveness of your in-flight crew

shrooms are like love and happiness
 you don't find them; they find you
if he really loved me
 wouldn't he moisturize
love ain't got nothin' to do with the way you smellin' right now
but if she loved me so much
 why did she point the shotgun at me
you know that susan already hates you
of course she's just doing it to be a bitch
i love susan
this one is for tobacco

 --lafayette & houston
last night we were so wasted we got naked and mounted the ram
and then watched fraggle rock 
watching dawson's creek is like studying for the sats
oh my god
 a refrigerator with a television in it
 my life's dream has just been realized
it's not called because they're lost
 it's called because the audience can't follow it
but if you don't have a television
 how do you watch porn
let's be honest: everyone knows he has the personality of an air conditioner
it's times like this i wish i carried a taser
he smell like a sanitation truck
 you know how when a sanitation truck drives by and it just smells nasty
 yeah
 he like 8 trucks in a row
 that girl over there is a great artist
 she did a fantastic job of drawing her eyebrows on her face
tourists are kinda like retards; i want to help
 but i just never seem to
i don't want no broke ass bitches
 she couldn't even rub two crackers together
 table 9 has had so much work done on her face
 too bad she still look busted
 what i don't think you understand is
 his parents are his mother and a pimp
i don't want to be sold for five dollars on the street
this company needs a hit like a crackwhore on payday
i don't think he's addicted to porn
 but i think he does
 like
 coke off hookers' asses
i couldn't tell if they were singers or prostitutes
so then the hooker walked in with a squeegee
 then i knew it had gone way too far
she's kind of the president of the prostitute guild
you know that anton webern's quartet for the end of time was performed in a concentration camp
 crazy
yeah
 he died real weird
 i forget how
 i think the nazis shot him
actually he was shot by allied soldiers
 he was breaking curfew smoking a cigarette
 and they mistook him for his brother-in-law
 who was an alleged nazi spy
 i see
 thanks
any other questions
 i just ride this train all day waiting to answer questions on twentieth-century music composition
 the next car has an expert on chekhov
 and the conductor studies philosophy
so anyway
 slavic girls are pretty hot
yeah
 for real
i call her a dirty slag
 she calls me a fat cow
 you know
yeah
but she says it in the most proper british accent
 so i don't really mind
yeah
 if i'm insulted in a foreign language
 what do i care
at least i still kept my perfume
oh my gosh
 did you leave your perfume behind
 i said i brought it with me
wait
 do you still have your perfume
do you remember what you promised me before you left
what
you don't remember what you promised me
i promise you things all the time
 i never remember any of them
the strokes could do anything and be hot
yeah
even
 like
 hmm
 i was going to say even if they were having a gay orgy
 but --
that would be hot anyway
yeah
 so they'd still be hot even if they
were peeing

 he's half black
 what
 he is
you're so hot
i just want you to have a threesome with me

sure
it's coffee
 i used water to rub it off
 but the water made it all wet
you should have used club soda
this is not a pet-friendly property
does it matter if my cat is toilet-trained
i don't understand
my cat doesn't have a litter box
 it uses the toilet
 does that help
i am not sure if that makes a difference
 how did you do it
i used a training kit
 citikitty
it might impress the owner
 but i am not sure it makes a difference
 does your cat flush
it will if that helps me get the apartment
daddy
 i want some of those
 when you're older
 girls are gonna be throwing you their panties

 i'm pretty sure she understood me
what happened to your eye
some little kid poked it out
is that a tattoo
yeah
people die from those
 you know
from tattoos
 they get tattoos
 then they get cancer
 and then they die
i just couldn't believe it
 just because i give my child everything he wants and asks for
 she has the nerve to tell me that i'm giving my son a sense of entitlement
i can't believe she said that
yeah
 the nerve
i could use that cane
 i pulled my hamstring last night
doing what
 changing diapers
 having sex with myself
you know how deodorant gives you cancer
yeah

 i realized it was just me opening and closing my eyes
the late show 
 the late show

that show is bad
 very
 very bad
 it will take you to hell
 repent for your sins now
where you do want to go today

we always go to a museum when you visit
 let's try a new one this time
 we haven't been to the guggenheim
 the museum of sex is interesting
museum of what
 museum of 
 they have that here
 please tell me you don't go there
 do you go to church these days
 hmmm
 do they have in this city
and the funny thing was
 she had no curtains
 right
yeah
yeah
 and i mean i wasn't entirely comfortable with that
 but what was i supposed to say
 "i'm not comfortable with my penis in your mouth right now"
you weren't gonna say that
i called him and i called him
 and he kept letting it go to voice mail
well
 maybe he wasn't there
 or maybe he just didn't want to talk to you
 like
 it could've been jesus on the phone
 and he wasn't answering
 jesus wouldn't call on a cell phone
so she looks at it with all the sauce
 and goes
 "that's not italian
" that's her whole classification system: everything's either italian or not italian
good thing the library doesn't use that system
one time i passed out
 then i woke up and was like
 "i am on the wrong line for this
" i had to get out and go back the other way
i'm such a wimp
 i take a cab when i get too drunk to know where i'm going
if we ever do go to vegas
 we have to see a brothel
isn't that where monks live
 man
 she's like a 4x4
 comfortable and fast
 and those curves
 shit
she's seventeen
right on
my shit is real
i can't believe he offered us $20 for that
we should have just took it
 $20 is $20
 we didn't even have to do anything
 we didn't even have to look
yeah
 true
 but can you imagine if those other two came around the corner while he was doing that
yeah
 you're right
 they would not only think we were crackheads
 but prostitutes too
wanna go to long island tonight
yeah
wait
 where on long island
i don't know
 where is long island
 anyway
spare some change for the fucking poor

you know what was bad
 black plague was 
and he said
 "i don't understand how i have stds and you don't
i'll have to sterilize it and burn it or it might give the fire an infection
so i had a touch of pneumonia
 and they had to remove part of my lung
 i was coughing up jello
but it was clear
 so it was okay
excuse me
 ladies and gentleman
 i'm hungry and i'm homeless
 if you could please spare some money or some food
 i'd appreciate it

 i'm gonna hit that motherfucker down there
 i know i only want to hit him because i've been drinking

 that kind of money
 giraffe money
my daddy makes a lot of money so my mommy and me can live the life we want to live
yeah
 so he was like
 "that's what it means to be rich
 i can buy whatever makes me and my fianc&eacute; happy
 i can buy her all the harry potter memorabilia that she wants
 if the weather is bad here in the hamptons i may just fly to california or south beach for the weekend
 hopefully nobody at work will need me because i may have to get a flight on friday morning

and by "me"
 i mean my parents

 don't you dare call them by colors
 they have names and letters and numbers
 the 4 is not the green train; it is the irt lexington avenue express
 the 6 is not the green train; it is the irt lexington avenue local
 an idiot in brooklyn asks for the orange train at king's highway
 it is not the orange train
 it is the f train
 he should be deported to mars for calling it the orange train
 the trains have names and letters and numbers
 and you never call 6th avenue the avenue of the americas
oh my god
 i am not new york enough for this
being a new yorker is great
 you get to give the finger to everybody and nobody seems to care
 i love this city
these people must love their sandwiches

 like
 right over my head
 i'm not going to waste the credits
 i'm just going to fail the class on purpose
i'm majoring in the doggy-style orgasm
most of you are familiar with the breasts of members of the opposite sex who are close to your own age

 but i know you're wrong
i can't go to the bathroom
 i can't eat grapes
 i'll be in a bubble

i would like to sing you a song now
 one that i wrote and i am very proud of
 it goes like this
 "lean on me
 when you're not strong
 and i'll be your friend
i don't mean to be pretentious
 but i have seen the palominos live
i realized early on that i wasn't being sexy enough with that song
 and then suddenly i was humping the air
dude
 what is this band playing
 is this phish
 seriously
 i'm really confused
i don't give a damn what the black people think
 i want evanescence
i had to get out of there
 i'm sorry
 but i just can't listen to tom waits as soon as i get into work
 it's too early for tom waits
 let me ease into my day first
 jesus
 see
 that's the common misconception
 myspace was originally the friendster for artists
oooh
 look at this one
 it only has one eye
 what happened
 it lost an eye
you want coach
 prada
 louis vuitton
 dvd
do you sell fake cigarettes
the fact that he's conservative doesn't intrinsically make him ugly
 there are attractive republicans
on unicorns with pots of gold
the red sox are fabulous
can you be any more gay
he's not even a partner
he shushed me and he's not even a partner
you know
 i kinda like richie santorum
yeah
 he's a pretty good guitarist
 bon jovi's alright
 am i fat
 now get in the airplane
dad says i'm husky
i mean
 i don't feel guilty about this
yeah
 yeah
 i know
i put a lot in this relationship
yeah
 yeah
i took time out from work
 time from the club
 time from my wife and kids
look at that sign
 what do you think means
i don't know
look at the picture
 so it's
 like
 an applebee's
what's your favorite art supply
vagina
dude
 i just knocked off work
where you working
the florist
dude
 that's pretty gangster
i'm up for anything
 you gotta change it up
 i just don't want to date a guy who's a stick-in-the-mud
well
 i can assure you
 my stick has been out of the mud for some time now
dude
 i'm so horny
 i'm thinking about considering asians
you can't threaten me with jail
 three hots and a cot
 i ain't nobody's momma
 and i ain't nobody's wife
 and i ain't above eating pussy
wait
 you don't take credit cards
yeah
 i got a machine right here in my arm
it's not good to flush the toilet while you're in the stall
because then everything that's in the toilet
 jumps out
ewww
look
 dad
 monkey bars
i wanna play on the pole
 you can't too
 this is my pole
bobby
 everyone can play on the pole
bobby
 go back to your pole
fine
 look
 dad
 i'm a pole dancer
yeah
 i just really don't like matthew mcconaughey's arms
 i mean
 he's an attractive guy
 but his arms are just
i know what you mean
 i guess
 they don't match his body
i was going to say i hope he gets cancer in his arms
 but i didn't mean it
i know
you know what today is a perfect day for
shopping
 gaelic football
so somehow we all ended up in our underwear
 then katie suggested truth or dare
 that was weird
 i had to give her a lap dance
 and sarah had to lick my tits
 and freaky stuff like that
 it was more like some lesbian orgy than a sleepover
that sounds
 so hot
oh my god
 i thought you were gay
i don't know how i'm gonna get bernie to go down on me
 i've even tried waxing
maybe you can tattoo a little yankees logo down there
are you kidding
 it would be a holy object
 he would kneel and make burnt offerings
at least he would be kneeling
 that's a start
i think that guy is waving to me
that's a streetlight
 maybe you shouldn't have eaten that third piece of paper
i can't wait 'til vegoose
you finally made it
yeah
 by the time i wake up
 get ready
 drive to the train station
 take the train
 then take the subway to get here all for a ten-minute interview
 it's
 like
 a total rim job
ummm
 at least you made it
yeah
 sometimes i like to suck on my fingers
are you selling those
of course not
 we're the police
you are such a disillusioned youth
wait
 what does that even mean
how should i know
 i just think it sounds good
do you want to go eat korean food
what does it taste like
it's like american food

--62nd & broadway

 i can always tell if a guy's a fag or not by whether he checks out my tits
 --penn station
i'm sayin' she used to have some good pussy and some big ole titties
 i'm talking double e-e's 
 and she went to the doctor and had them cut off
 her titties was cut off
maybe i'll do that
 or maybe i'll just give myself a boob job with a rusty butter knife and water balloons
well
 it's not like you can't say you've never had your bosom in somebody's elbow before
my momma said
 "all you gotta do is beat the hell out the biggest one of them
 and the rest will fall in line
" and she was right
 too
 --23rd & 11th
she went and married that man who her first husband shot her for goin' out with
 --foley square

 my love handles are out of control
 when i was getting ready tonight
 my fat got caught in my zipper
 --49th & 2nd
if i die fat
 whatever
 just as long as i make everyone else fat before i go
 that's fine
 they can diet after i'm gone
 just keep my recipes is all i'm sayin'
 ya know
there should be more laws about people on planes
 i once had to sit next to this really fat guy
 he was so unapologetic about it
 the rogue fat was spilling onto me
they're so ugly
 and a lot of them haven't started smoking yet so they're really fat
i didn't get any
 stupid fat lady
you ever seen a fat guy fall on a car
 like
 the car just happened to be there
and you are not a lesbian either
 you are only gay on weekends
i know jimmy's not gay because he stole my girlfriend
mark my words--by sunrise you will be smothered in lesbians
i always thought that if i were gay i'd be the manlier one
 but now that i think about it i'd want to be the girly one for all the free stuff
wait
christ
 it's gayer than three snaps in z formation in here
that is complete bullshit
 how do you make a dog gay
it's funny talking to him now
 i mean
 in the eighth grade we knew he was gay
 but not take-it-up-the-butt gay
this is a downtown 4 train making local stops
 i repeat

i don't know if you believe in reincarnation or anything
 but i just have this feeling that my mother and i have a lot of shit to work out
 maybe in my next life she'll just be my cat or something
what would you name her
pussy
so what happened
 why did you two break up
she's a slut
 her vagina's the gateway to hell
you can go ahead of me with your "lady things
you mean the maxi-pads or the baby
yeah
 i need to buy a new cell phone; mine is broken
how come
i dropped it in the sand during my vacation
that's how it broke
 it was fine but the sand was all over it
 so i decided to rinse it clean with pouring water from the bathroom sink
what are you doing there
 but no hands
 one teen takes three long strides and leaps on top of a mailbox
 wobbles precariously
 touches one finger on a wobble
 and stands straight up
used your hands
i wonder how come you don't see more men here
shit
 'cause they ain't got patience for this shit
 i been here for four hours
yo nigga
 that's why i go shopping
so if i get the big mac but get a diet coke
 it won't matter
 right
yeah
 because the diet coke has like no calories
 so it will be like just eating a hamburger without having anything to drink
so i won't get fat
 totally not
when i was dying
 i had a thing with monkeys
really
 monkeys
yeah
 they were everywhere
so i said
 "well
 you all are
 like
 almost hot
wait
 why did you do that
 i wasn't going to hook up with any of them
 so then i said
 "see
 it's like you all could be hot
 like she has a nice ass
 you have a nice nose
 i just wish i could put all of you together and create one big frankenpussy
if there are no rules at this place
 could i go have sex with that hostess
dude
 i think that would be rape
quit turning around and walk
 bitch
 i ain't gonna rape you
you ain't even my type
 too skinny
 i like 'em big
nobody looks at you here
 nobody looks into your eyes
they probably would if we were better looking
foreigners are killing this city
those people seemed like americans
but they're foreign to new york
what do you mean
 he has a beaver
beeper
 he has a
 she's not ugly
 she's just a jew
why did you do that
i'm sorry
 i didn't know what it was
if you do that again the police will arrest you
really
 george bush will come and take you to jail
what
he will kill you and put your picture on the wall of memories [ground zero feature]
yeah
 it made fun of hitler
 but it was in
 like
 a positive way
mommy
 mommy
 i want a fish
because first you'll like it
 then it'll start to smell
 then it will die
 and then you'll cry
i mean
 don't tell him i told you that
 you can't tell him i said anything
 or he will flip his shit
it's vagina night
i want to fuck you someplace fairly uncomfortable
so what should i do for mike for his 21st
well
 just make him an id so you guys can go out at least
they just did an autopsy on my mother
what
yeah
autopsy
 she didn't fuckin' die
 you asshole
 an autopsy
 yeah
 on my mother
 it's benign

 you need to shut the fuck up and watch with me
 you can learn shit on there
you see
 i don't have that problem because i don't have any of my teeth left

 i like that martha stewart

he is like the l
 ron hubbard of teach for america
you fuckers don't deserve to be here
 john lennon died for peace and tolerance
 get the fuck out of here
 queers
 john died for peace and humanity
yeah
 he wouldn't watch my kid last night because he was hanging out with wilmer valderrama
betty boop killed martin luther king
 the last time i went fishing i got a fishing lure stuck in my dick
everybody's somebody on my dick
can you be a little more subtle and not such a dick-swinger about your amstel light
at least i don't suck dicks for free
my redeeming factor is i will suck fucking dick to make money
take it like a bowl of dicks
so i asked her
 and she gave me her number
 and then it was disconnected
 so i went back the next week
 and she wasn't working there anymore
 so i wondered
 did she quit her job just to avoid sucking my dick
why would they invade lebanon
 we've got nothing they want
 all we've got are 
it's
 like
 so old testament
 they really need to come up off that shit
 honey

 i'm in manhattan
 not lebanon
where's hezbollah
like
 it's a city in iran
 right
i don't know
 he was either jewish or polish or something
he had on that little beanie
 you know
i like you because i can say all this ignorant jewish stuff
 and you know what i'm talking about
no it's all going to be fine
 we already locked up the rabbi
jews for jesus
 what kind of racist shit is that
 negro
i was at a klan meeting when i found out i was jewish
 i just about hung myself
they were either orthodox jews or rocky horror fanatics
 other people in the middle east do not really hate jews
 we are very similar to jews
 actually
 egyptians and palestinians and lebanese and israelis
 all of us make lots of deli foods that have lots of spices and names that are fun to say
and if you are egyptian
 the war does not mean so much
 if you grew up there
 you grew up with the giant pyramids
 you know the pyramids
 yes
 well you can see them from the city
 and you think "who built those
 slaves
 who did they build them for
 dead people
" and then things like wars do not bother you so much
fucking
 are you fucking
beating off
what's that sound
i don't know; i'm out of guesses
so we fucked it up
 it's friday anyway
 i don't have to look at it no more
if you heard your name
 or something that sounds like it could be your name
 please board your plane
 it is leaving
okay
 people
 have your boarding passes out
 if you don't have your boarding passes out
 i'm sending you to amtrak
welcome to the parking lot known as laguardia airport
the mist you are seeing is caused by a difference in temperature
 the temperature outside is different from the temperature inside
 once we close the door and prepare for take-off
 the mist will disappear
 which will make us very sad because we like mist
good afternoon
 passengers
 we are about to make our final descent into john f
 kennedy international airport
 so buckle your seatbelts and hold on tight
in the event of a loss of cabin pressure
 oxygen masks will be released from the overhead above your seat
 after the screaming subsides
 please place the oxygen mask around your nose and mouth
 if you are traveling with a child or an adult who is acting like a child
 place your mask on first before attempting to help put theirs on
and for those of you who wish to smoke
 quit
 and if you want to smoke inside
 you came to the wrong state

i'd leave my wife for her if her clit didn't taste like a spicy tuna roll
i don't care how many fingers you put in her
 bottom line is
 she didn't blow you
 so i win
a blow job is better than no job
$50 for a 2-minute bj
 i'd do it
 it takes me 8 hours to make $50
 shit
 did she orgasm in your mouth
i'm thinking of getting that little string thing attached to my tongue cut off so i can eat pussy better
well if i'm not giving you head and you're not giving me head then we've got a problem
i hate eating fish
 except when my grandma makes it
 she makes it taste like beef

 like putting your saggy tits back in your shirt
i would totally pay her back and all
 but
but what
but she's a fucking cokehead is what
 if anyone's gonna buy coke with my money
 it will be me
what does that mean
 that the movie has subtitles
 isn't it in english
 it's in english
 but it has subtitles for the disabled
so it's for the illiterate or something
what stop is this
what time is it
8 o'clock
oh dear god
 [runs off train]
my tits feel weird
what do you mean
i did party tits at the share this weekend
what
party tits
 you get saline injected into them

 it wears off in a few days
 the guys love it
you know what auntie cathy* said last week
 she said that
 back in the 40's
 aunt mary* was a huge slut
 she said
 and i quote
 "she had the clap so many times it amounted to applause
and i thought the only hobby she ever had was crocheting those ugly stuffed animals
i don't care what you say
 i just wanna get a big stroller and have my wife push me around
 i don't care what you say
 that's pimp
 that's pimp

 because
 if you are
 you should be nicer to yourself
brooklyn is a vienna-style lager
 i'm giving away a t-shirt to the first person who can name another vienna-style lager that is brewed in the u
sam adams
very good
 and i give this t-shirt to you
 except that you're a boston fan
 better luck next time
 [continues tour
i'm sorry
 i didn't mean to insult your computer
 i didn't know it was a cheap computer
 i'm sorry
you didn't insult my computer
 you insulted my socio-economic status
look
 lady
 if you want to have your dog off leash
 you can bring it in after nine o'clock at night
 that's a great idea
 i'll just bring my dog into central park after nine
 and get raped
what good is a dog if it can't stop you from getting raped
so i've always kind of wondered
you know how ants are so small
 we're probably too big to be completely perceived and understood by them
 i always wondered if there were beings that were so large they were beyond capabilities of perception and comprehension
that
 like
 totally doesn't make any sense
why not
'cause
 like
 when it rained on 
 then get washed away
 duh
so they made fun of her
 no one would make fun of her
 she had big boobs
yeah
 so he really slept with her
 it's gross
 she looks like a drag queen
if she really was a drag queen
 that would be hot
 though
yeah
what's that
that's the belly button
 it helps you breathe
i'd rather lose my legs than my hands
i could probably lose a couple of fingers and still be happy
what if you lost your dick
i'd just turn it in and make a vagina
so you'd basically turn yourself into a woman
 i'd still be a man
 but with a vagina
but you wouldn't feel anything
i'd still use it
i'm really not looking forward to getting up at 6:30 to go to work
me neither
 but remember: they wanted you to be a doctor
yeah
 i'm doing it because they wanted me to
 i'm so angry
 i'm fumigating
it's like that time i had mono and sat on my stoop for three days
 whittling wood
i swear to god
 if you tell that story one more time i'm going to shoot myself
are you ready to de-colonize columbus day
hell yes
 honey
 i'd de-colonize america israel for you
so you're saying don't hate avocados
 i don't hate the avocados just for being avocados
 i would never smash an avocado
 i just want them to make up their minds
 they need to decide
good to know
 i went to his myspace to find out who his babymomma was
 right
 and then he calls me and says i have aids
wait
 aids
 you mean hiv
 right
 aids
well
 then i get hiv
 you can get aids
 but i want hiv
my friends and i are thinking of making a movie called 'hitler is right
what was he right about
about the jews
 if he had finished what he started
 there would be no more jews and the world would be better
and we wouldn't exist either
why not
because he also killed non-aryans
 homos
 and deaf people
really
 well
 i still think hitler was right
today was such an incredible day
 i met richard branson
 and
 fabian
 that's why i love you so much
wait
 he's 28
yeah
 i know
 he's asian
have you ever wondered why there are no
 like
 sexy midgets
 but sometimes i wonder if you are slightly retarded
next stop
 110th

really
 why
because i'm 20
what's his name
ummm
nice
 real nice
 you're a class act
i still have at least three years before i have to worry about being classy
that's pretty much illegal or something
they're not really related
 and she told her dad and he's cool with it
oooh
 do you wanna get some ice cream
remember that pussy i was hittin' a few weeks ago
yeah
she's in a coma now
that reminds me of that smiths song
 'girlfriend in a coma
' have you ever heard it
you have to hit a kid to teach him respect
sure it does
 remember when i stole that stuff when i was younger and dad hit me
 that taught me the respect that i needed not to steal
you still steal
yeah
 but not from my family
you know what would be cool
 if you guys
 like
 wore tibetan monk outfits while you did that
 that'd be cool
ummmm
when i look back on my life
 i'm not going to think about trips i went on or relationships i had
 i'll be thinking about television programs i watched
that's horrible
well i was only kidding
never give up 
 don't you ever give up
but why even try
 everyone loses in the end
high street
 oh man
 we're back in brooklyn
ummm
 we never left brooklyn
 the next stop is in manhattan
do you see that young man over there
 do you want his first life lesson to be me whuppin' yo' ass
so we went to a baptism yesterday
wait
 you're catholic
 not baptism
 i'm baptism
i can't believe you like going to this leather bar
 the guys here are so scary
not all of them
 there are a few gems with all their hair
 no visible gut and a strong immune system
yeah
 but she was too fat
oh my god
 i can't wait to move into the city
 i can't take my house anymore
 my parents are always up my ass
 gabby
 what time will you be home
 gabby
 don't forget to tell rosa to pick up your dry cleaning
 gabby
 we're paying your tuition
 you can't treat this house like a hotel
 it's so 
 i just wanna be on my own
 i can take care of myself
 i don't need them constantly doing stuff for me
yeah
 so where were you thinking of moving
i dunno
 my dad said he might let me move into his apartment on 89th
 either that
 or a partner at his firm is selling a co-op that he might buy for me
 he said i can choose
i want a baby
you can't have a baby yet
you just can't
what do you mean 'i just can't'
 you're not the ruler of my vagina
which mike
 fun mike or shitty mike
i always forget which one is which with you
fun mike always pays for everything
 shitty mike always has no money and throws up
you'd think i could keep that straight
excuse me
 miss
 excuse me
 excuse me 
 woman
dude
 i'm not a tourist
 sorry
 don't you think it's inappropriate to be drinking gin and tonics everyday before noon
 it's ok
 i only drink in the mornings
 being mormon
 you don't have premarital sex right
yeah
 basically
nice talkin' to ya
wait
 come back
i need to pick up my child from daycare
 where would she be
what age group
i think she's one
 look at this picture
yeah
 she never would have made cheerleader if she had two legs
so if i don't take the pill
 will i have to have a thousand babies
 that's not how it works
if we had a real house
 i'd decorate it like crazy
yeah
my worst fear is falling on a picket fence or getting eaten by a shark
oh yeah
 well my worst fear is someone pushing me forward onto a blackboard and having my teeth scrape down the front
 that would be awful
spare some change
sorry
 i don't like homeless people
so are you gonna come out drinking tonight
uh no
 i haven't been feeling so well
 i'm allergic to rain i think
ummm
 it's not raining
yeah
 it must have been earlier or something
where were you
i had to go sign some autographs
she is singing
 she's playing the saw
there is an orchestra playing
it is a tape
and she is singing
what did you say
 have a look
it's like singing
that's it
 the saw
what a nice voice she has
she is not singing
 it's the saw that's singing
no way
 she is singing into the saw
 no singing
 just sawing
but she is opening her mouth
she is breathing
are you sure she is not singing
i used to be delusional
what was happening
 were you medicated
oh yes
 i had to be severely medicated
 i thought i was going to marry peter jennings
was it hard for you when he died
actually
 i was selfishly happy because i didn't have to worry about having delusions about him anymore
mommy
 mommy
 can i get some ice cream
i ain't gettin' you no ice cream
 ain't no holiday
is so
 it's the jewish new year
so i felt really bad for him because he's 53 years old and just got fired from the one job he knows how to do
 but then he got that horse and his life turned around
i know
 he has a large studio in soho so it has plenty of room to run around
 and now he no longer has to ride in cabs or subways
yeah
 i should get a horse too
aww man
 anna nicole's son died
dude

ask him what happened on dragonball z last night and i bet he could tell you
naw man
 i missed it yesterday
yeah man
 there's some fucked up shit going on
word son
 niggas killin' niggas
it's a win-win situation
 when did you get your period
don't use that word

your id doesn't scan

 i paid extra for scanable
sorry about the delay
 i had to pee
 so i went
what did she say
she had to pee
 and she went
ohhh man

 get off the train or we're not moving
 you can't play here
you're just jealous that i make more than you
that susan's such a whore
yeah
 but wouldn't you be
what
you know
 hypothetically
 if you could get people to sleep with you
dude
 there are so many restaurants around here
weird
you better shut the fuck up unless you want to get your ass whipped in front of all these white people
but i'm still a g
 bartender
 do you know what a car bomb is
 it's spanish for
 'you're an asshole
i just did it to jump start my diet
you smoked crack
just for a couple weeks
 to lose the initial weight
and then what did you do
now i just eat half an avocado a day
that is not correct use of that word
yes it is
you don't emit a noxious odor when you 'bifurcate'
will you love me forever and ever
 even if you broke up with me and shot me and cut me into little bits and set the bits on fire
i would never break up with you
 what kind of work you in
social work
where do you work
shit
 can you find her kid
 they got him in foster care
 sorry
 i don't work for child services
 contact your county officials and explain your situation to them
yeah i don't know where he is at
 can you get him
i work at planned parenthood
 sorry
just 'cause you're pretty you can't treat people like shit
just because you do drugs doesn't mean you shouldn't brush your teeth
i am celibate
 man
 get over here
 she comes back to the dorm alone and crying
 and we're like 'what happened
 where did that guy go
' and she tells us that he got a ticket from a cop
 for getting a blowjob in front of the un
is that
 like
 a different thing than getting a blowjob somewhere else
well
 he had an internship there or something
 maybe he got a discount
guess what my mom told me that your mom told her the other day when we were playing
 she had another baby before you and it died
 my mom said that i'm the oldest
you are now 'cause the other one died
 she died before she was even born
that's impossible
 you can't die before you are born
yes you can
 you can die before you are born
 while you are born
 or after
 you can die at any time and you don't even have to do anything bad
i don't want to play with you anymore
--manhattan bound f train
this is my day every day
 i sleep until around 9:30 and i get up and i answer my emails
 then
 i work for a couple of hours and then i watch the view 
 and then i eat lunch and i basically meditate and contemplate everything for a few hours
 and then i watch 
 so i can cry my eyes out for all the poor people in africa
 then i eat dinner and i go shopping with my parents at the mall
 it sounds like a spa
 my life is like a spa
free tote bag with a purchase of a t-shirt
how much is the t-shirt
hell no
 25 bucks for a t-shirt
 stop being such a jew
you should say excuse me
i did say excuse me

i don't have any money
that's alright
 papi will pay

&quot;
my dad set up my laptop stuff
yeah
 i don't know how to do it either
 my boyfriend did mine
i don't have a guy like that

 you made out with robert
 and you slept with jimmy
robert kissed me
 i didn't kiss him
yeah
 everyone says i'm really bohemian

 she said she is butch masculine
 whatever that means

that tongue twister &quot;sally sells seashells at the seashore&quot; is whacked

because it's nice and people are too lazy to look for a nice seashell in the seashore
what will they do with a seashell
 just look at it
you can listen to the ocean if you put it in the ear
why would i buy a seashell to listen to the ocean if i can listen to the ocean right there

i'm trying so hard to lose weight
 but i'm having the hardest time
you have to cut out sugar
 that's what i do
you look really smart today
i look really smart
 why
 because i'm putting corn starch on my wet parts

it ain't halloween until you hit the ground
don't touch the white girl

 we have the same blood
 your blood is black -- your blood is shit
 my blood is blue just like yours
 besides
 if i don't come here to your store to spend money
 how are you going to afford the bombs to blow up buildings
but what exactly does that mean
 'doesn't shit where he eats'
 i'll kick his ass
it means 'not dating someone you work with
 okay
 i thought he was saying my pussy smells bad
 you never worked a day of construction in your life
 son
i dabbled
 he told me that i had the prettiest pussy he had ever seen
 what did you say
i said
 'thank you
' my mother told me to always take a compliment gracefully
you could just be gay
i don't want to be gay
 i just wanna be a woman

 i needed a costume where my breasts could be an accessory

 canada breaks up over there
i swear to god
 it's connected to canada
is it weird that i'm usually more horny when i'm on my period

you know what
 i'll help you
 i'll go to your house right now and take some pictures of you with your shirt off
 and then you can send them to jimmy
 okay

i don't know why
 but i've been thinking about this a lot
 and maybe you could
 like
 help me out and clear this up or whatever
 what about death and stuff
that's a great segue
so he is definitely going to turn out gay
come he is not going to be gay
 you just think that because he is a nice
 well-dressed boy
 exactly
well
 he is asian
 all the guys in asia wear makeup
stop talking
 he's only half-asian
 and gay
if you were convicted of murder
 who would you send to ride to the king to get a pardon
a rider
can you spell that
 do you mean a 'writer'

so what is important is his sportsmanship
maybe a servant
 a friend of the king
what is one of the oldest professions
a prostitute
a lawyer

 and she
 like
 can't talk that much either 'cause she can hardly breathe
but isn't she a porn star
 when she like
 you know
 has an orgasm
 how can she make those loud noises
 her career is so over
maybe she has a ventriloquist
no way
 that'd only work if she was a guy and it was gay porn
 'cause
 i mean
 who's ever heard of a girl ventriloquist
does anybody want my college brochures
 i got them today
 but i'm not going to any of them
 so does anybody want them

 you're not a girl
 so you can't have them
come on
 let me have them
 to go to this school you have to have a vagina
 and unless you have a sex change in the next three months
 you're going to miss the deadline anyway
just let me have them
oh yeah
 i forgot

 there was sun and clouds -- you would love it
 the roads are crazy -- driving there is mad good
 they're all big and you can speed and the cops won't pull you over because there is so much other illegal-- well they got all those illegal aliens

' i told her
 'what the fuck

 cam'ron be doin' some gay shit
 but he always calls 'no homo' so it's aight
so if cam'ron asked you to suck his dick 'no homo

well
 if he called 'no homo
you're too thick for me to properly give you head
 though

 when men take forever and a day to finish
 let's say the average woman likes five minutes of sex
 but he keeps going and going and thirty minutes later she's thinking
 'hey

we only like it for five minutes
why is it that everyone who goes away to college loves dave matthews band or o
i don't know
 but they both suck
that's why i left school
 i fucking hate dave matthews band
yo man
 i hate when it's fucking raining like this
yeah
 that's why we got this blunt
yeah

 he has sort of sandy hair -- like a cross between me and his mom
 lisa
 you know
 he has big nipples like lisa
oh man
 my foot really hurts
well maybe if you weren't such a dumbass it would get better
yeah
 you know
 my oldest son's father wasn't circumcised
really
yeah
what'd it taste like
 let me read the horoscope
the horoscope says it's going to rain today and be really cold
and that it's a good day to die
 what's necrophilia
jesus christ

 i can't think of anything worse than that
i can
 the holocaust
all i'm saying is that if jesus was beautiful on the inside
 he was beautiful on the outside
 so i know he had ladies looking at him
well
 i know everything began in africa
that's right
 you know they have the indentation in africa where the devil landed
 they built a church over it to try to make it holy
 i saw it on the exorcist

 long island girls and new york city girls are the same thing
 it is not okay to wear tommy hilfiger sweatshirts

oh my god
 seriously
i wouldn't want to tangle with you
 bitch
i can't believe you just called me a bitch
 that is so offensive
don't be so uptight

 so chill
i just don't get this play at all
you want me to teach you to play minesweeper
okay

 you don't have to fuck around with everyone on the street
what's the fun of wearing a fake
 five-dollar chinatown shirt if i'm not gonna make fun of those assholes in the process
 that can't be true
i'm dead serious -- i couldn't make that up
 you are honestly telling me that if you don't wash your ball sack
 you will grow cheese
i think sandy* has dyslexia
how do you know

 but she's just so skinny
does titty-fucking actually feel good
 or does it just look hot

 he said that he wants to start smuggling drugs
 too
 i said to him
 'dad
 you cannot become a drug dealer
oh my god
 you know he would totally do that just to get attention
so now he's telling me we need a kid
 i don't want one
 but he says we can adopt and avoid all the messy stuff
so are you going to
i said i'd consider it if we can get one that's actually white
 you know
 'cause you never really know what they're giving you
that's so true
isis
 come back over here
 don't wander off - stay where i can see you
woman
 you name 'isis
' and i wander as far away from you as i can get
 i don't blame that girl
 isis
 what kind of name is that for a little white girl
 damn
 now i white people crazy
i really hate her
 i just really can't stand her
 me neither
 she's such a bitch
did you know she's a robot

it's probably because people here on the east coast are too beaten down by the wind and the shame
when did slavery end

 1970

 dad said only if you're really good and you don't fight with your sister anymore

fine
 then she's a reverse b-and-t troll dyke
'the a- of psychology'
dude
 it's 'anals
' you're so stupid
and what was the issue in this case
the company was displaying won-ton negligence
okay
 good
 but some people pronounce it 'wanton
are you you want the really hot sauce
 and not the regular hot sauce
 why
want me to describe it
 it's like if i tear out your asshole and tickle it
 yeah
 i told him i cheated on him
 so you don't really love him
 then
you think so
 darling
 when you love someone
i know
 i know
 you don't cheat on them
 when you really love someone
 you cheat and never tell
you're so ahead of me
what would you do if i just suddenly grew a penis
well
 first i'd scream
 then
 i'd probably jack you off

 50 years for that to work
 this hobo on the train is selling paris hilton's urine as perfume

 i love paris hilton
i swear
 if she asks me if i love her one more time i'm going to punch her in the goddamn face
 she's driving me up a fucking wall
maybe you should just break up with her
what
 and be alone
whatever
 i just don't like him
 okay
i just don't think him being smelly should have anything to do with it
i can't believe they put up fucking scaffolding on my building
what's the big deal
once they put it up
 it never comes down
 and you never see anyone ever working on it
it's just scaffolding
 dude
 you need to get laid
have you ever noticed that lemon-lime soda tastes like urine after a few minutes of not drinking it
nope
well
 it does
 that's why you have to keep drinking it -- so it doesn't taste bad
 then you get addicted to it and you buy more
 it's a clever marketing scheme
has the government been probing your brain lately

 hot people are a dime a dozen
yeah
 okay
but i'm in no hurry
 by any means
that's a good place to be
 i'm not about seriousness at all
 i take everybody as they are
 i'm just trying to get laid
 it's so hard to find someone hot smart who also has a good heart
totally
i'm a total hippie
that's a good thing
so say we bang
oh my god
 could you imagine living in that apartment building with no windows
honey
nigga

i think he just wanted to go out in the street and have a hipster fight about it

 they see who can eat the least amount of food
 they see who can squeeze into the tiniest pants
that's funny
 but i don't see how that solves anything
whatever -- fucking hipsters
taking family members on a sex safari is not a good idea
it was hardly a sex safari
 idiot
 i just took my brother to a massage parlor
i think my roommate is anorexic -- she never eats
 and she's lost like 40 pounds this year

my agency is the only place where i feel at home
 'cause none of the men want to fuck me

 i should
 huh
you know gandhi
 the indian guy with the bald head and the robes
 yeah -- he starred in that film
do you ever feel like you're not enough
 like the more you try

 it's like
 every game of solitaire i play
 the lower score i get
no money
 so i stopped dating him
whore
excuse me
nice thighs -- have another doughnut
and so i told him
 'i love new york
 and i'm not coming back to portland
 when you get home
 pack up our stuff and come out to new york
 you better marry that boy
well
 he's already married
it's okay
 i'm in no hurry

no decaf
 no decaf
 that's the problem
every time i see you
 you look younger
younger
 fresher
 more rejuvenated
i'll remember you in my will
you mean
 your parents never kept you in a cage as a child
 the gold one is called 'cd3' or something

 'r4m23
i think the gold robot was named 'r3dm24
' it was the small one that was 'c-something
 man
 the gold guy was 'c3ddo
' and the little silver one was 'rh52' or some shit
the gold one is 'c3po' and the smaller one is 'r2-d2'

 i asked all over the hospital and no one knows where my id card is
 i asked everywhere
which hospital
 vincent's
yeah
 vincent's
do you know who brought you there
 i have no idea how i got there
 so how can i help you
how can i find my id card

 or go to id services and see if someone turned it in
okay
 thanks
 bye
i hate how words can sometimes spell other words
yeah
 i know
 i overheard that weird girl in my anthropology class talking about how she bought a glass dildo the other day
a glass one
 i didn't even know they made glass ones
yeah
 i don't know
 but imagine if it cracked -- how much that would hurt
did you ask her about it
fuck no
 i figured i'd just google it later
my family is full of sluts
 my sister just had a baby
 my cousin just had a baby
 my other sister just had a baby
so your mom's a slut
 also
 my mom ain't a slut
fuck
 fuck
 fuck
 fuck
 fuck
 fuckin' fuck
why is that lady shouting
she's probably upset about something
maybe she ran out of pineapple and forgot to get more at the store
 or maybe her undershirt itches
 or maybe her gerbil is sick
i have a question -- what is the plural for 'clitoris'
that is a question
 you drinking tonight
it's tuesday
 of course i'm drinking tonight
wait
 so he broke up with you
 what a jerk
i know
 but whatever -- it's his loss
but did he even tell you why
 what a piece of shit
well
 but i think it had something to do with me not liking guys or the fact that i slept with his sister
 but he didn't tell why
 exactly
 yeah
 okay then
ehhh
what
 had enough of black girls
 it would be awesome to go trick-or-treat here tonight
idiot
 jews have halloween in april or something
so what's the deal with that chick who was talking to you
well
 i think she's absolutely atrocious
 but yeah
 i'd hit that
 so i went to that sushi place you told me to go to last night
 and i got food poisoning
 hey
 you went there
 how was it
i got food poisoning
yeah
 but how was it before the vomiting set in
my teacher bought this awesome notebook for me
'cause she likes me

 'cause then you'll just break your leg
 i love you
 i don't want you to
i'm sorry
 i just can't be with you anymore
 you're too clingy
i'm not clingy
 i fucked
 like
 ten other guys
while we were dating
whatever
 it was because you're not that good in bed
 yeah
 i faked all my orgasms
 by the way
 and my boobs
 --aren't water balloons
dude
 first of all
 we're on a motherfucking-packed subway
 second of all
 being a crazy bitch isn't going to help your case
you can't break up with me
 i you
 i you
 i love you
if you're thinking of killing yourself after this
 i sell knives
how was your weekend
shitty
well
 when did you first suspect your mother was gay
i don't wanna talk about it
 okay
so we went out on thursday
 and he didn't call me friday or saturday
 which was good
 then he showed up at the party on sunday and didn't talk to me for the first 35 minutes
 yesterday
 he left me a message telling me how nice the party was
 and i haven't called him back
but you like him
yeah
 i think it's going well
do you have pancetta
we have white cetta and orange cetta
okay
 do you have prosciutto
i better watch out -- after the weight i lost
 my mom is thinking i'm anorexic or something
 i should start eating more
yeah
 or lay off the coke
or that
nudists are rich
really
 why
they don't have to buy clothes
[in the month of october] why is there a leprechaun passed out on those steps
 wow
 is it april fools' day
so my mother insisted on coming into the room when i had my last pelvic exam
seriously
what's worse is that she was standing near the doctor while he was doing the exam
 she was watching
what
 no way
then she said to the doctor
 'can i hold something for you
booga-wooga-wooga
you are a crazy man
shish-ka-bobba-bobba
cockadoodledoo
you are a crazy boy
what's the candy situation
more

oooh
 dad
 i love you
i love you
 too
 buddy
 but you don't have to tell me that when you are on the crapper
 look at all those big trophies
those ain't trophies
 there's dead people there
 yeah
 you know -- you go to church
 you pray
 and they put the dead person in the box
 and they put the box in there
 don't you go to church
it's almost like
 a pseudo-lesbian crush
 i mean
 i don't wanna touch her or anything
yeah
 i don't wanna touch her
 i just
i just
 like
 want her to lay in my bed with me and tell stories
i want to be more like that
what
 ugly
