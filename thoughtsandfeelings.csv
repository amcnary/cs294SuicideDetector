I'm in so much turmoil & the pain is horrendous,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/im-in-so-much-turmoil-the-pain-is-horrendous.122120/,"I have such up and down emotions about my wife.

I can get to thinking that I need to improve myself  and let her see I'm strong & confident so she finds me hopefully attractive again, then I can seconds later think it's all hopeless & I have to do away with myself as I can't cope with the pain of not being with her.

My latest thought is that I would have to literally move to the other side of the country to try to forget her as being where I am just constantly reminds me of her.

All my family & kids are here but that doesn't make the slightest difference in my mind.

I'm so wrapped up in my wife that nothing else seems to matter.

I have never felt so bad in all my life.

I actually went to work today for the first time in 3 weeks, I was so messed up lately that I just went off for a week or so just to get away from it all.

I really don't think I can ever be normal again without her in my life.

I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow to see if he can change my meds as the last lot didn't do anything for me,

This whole situation has completely knocked the life out of me.

I'm so unhappy & miserable."
What will happen to me?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/what-will-happen-to-me.122131/,"I want to get help because of my suicidal thoughts. But whenever I mention feeling suicidal nobody thinks I will actually go through with it. This time I have a plan so I should really tell somebody before its too late. But they'll just tell my parents and that will be that. If not then I'm scared. I'm scared that they'll put me in some kind of mentally ill hospital or something and I'm not sure I like the sound of that. At all. What will people think of me? I'll miss so much school. I'll mess up so much. 



But I'm truly serious about this suicide attempt and when it gets to the day - will I pull through or give in? Because its not like being dead won't mess up everything anymore than getting help will. Does anyone know what will happen if I tell somebody about this? I'm so scared and I feel so alone with these feelings. I know my time is running out but while I'm in an okay place I don't want Tiger to end it early. I don't want to die but I'm being pushed into it by other sides of me. It feels like I'm being bullied by my own different ghosts. I don't know what to do."
i think I'm just too tired,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-think-im-just-too-tired.122239/,I think I'm just too tired to keep going. I have so much pain psychological and physical. I read other posts and can relate so strongly to the unbearable pain and fatigue. I am of absolutely no use to anyone. What is the point? If you take away the emotion you wouldn't want someone in so much pain to have to continue. Surely no-one is expected to live with pain like this
"What is the point, really?",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/what-is-the-point-really.121847/,"I'd like to unload a bit, if that's okay.  I'm about 2.5 years into a depression that feels like it's just taken over my life.  It sucks to put it mildly.   



I'm nearing my 40's and on the outside, have a good thing going on.  Married with 2 kids, nice house, good job etc etc.  It's on the inside where none of it feels good.  I've not been honest with myself all along.  



I've been married for 16+ years, and have come to realize that I got married because that's what I was ""supposed to do"".  Because I was afraid I'd not find better... so settled for good enough.  It's never been ideal and I've known that for a long time.  Before having kids, the thought ""I should get a divorce"" crossed my mind many times, yet I stayed.  When we had kids, I honestly thought it would make our relationship stronger, but instead my wife has become a great mom, and I feel like a shit dad and a worse husband.  To make it tougher, we've had our share of medical troubles with the kids, and I feel incapable of coping with these disappointments.



Over the years, sex & intimacy went from not-great, to worse, to nothing at all.   My outlet turned to self-gratification, which led to fantasies that are not the ""norm"".  I think my wife has an idea, but it's never been discussed.   It's like the elephant in the room (but it may be the elephant in my mind).  Eventually I cheated, thinking that it's not cheating if there's no sexual relationship that you're cheating on. WRONG, I cheated on my wife and hurt her.  I did it to make myself feel better, and it only made it worse.



Then there's a lack of out-of-marriage relationships.  Friendships.  I have a long pattern of losing friends... and eventually realized I no longer make new friends.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to be friends with me.  I have little to add of value.  I'm not interesting.  I even stopped drinking.   Despite those boo-hoo's,  I have an awful memory, which makes being a good friend possible.   Remember when???  Nope.  I do not.    The friends that I do have are work related or college friends who I see 1-2 times per year.  It's sad.  I don't have guys to get a drink with, watch the game with... nothing like that.  I am lonely   I chose work over friends... and now I'm left friendless.



Speaking of work, that too has become a huge stress.  I like my job.. but I've had it for 15+ years, and have realized many times over I should leave (sound familiar?)  but I stayed for the money.  Raises turned into a great salary that my lifestyle now depends on.  I can't make less but I make more than I deserve (and could make elsewhere).  We have a single income home (no pressure there), and I spend everything I make.  OVEREXTENDED  The problem is I took my work for granted and let myself coast.  Instead of building relationships & networking (much like my lack of friends) I rode my bosses coattails.  I did the work, rather than got the work.  Now all these years later,  I'm expected to keep the business going by getting work, and have very few connections, limited experience (just the one job) no confidence and no motivation.   I delegated so much I don't feel I know how to do my job well anymore.  I am rapt with ANXIETY about this... which exacerbates the depression.  I am finally trying to fix it, but because of my mental state, it's next to impossible.  I waited too long, and I fear every day that I will lose my job, which means I'll lose my house, and ruin my family further.  Why would I lose my job?  Because my company is becoming less financially viable as I'm not bringing in the work.  I was supposed to be the future, but instead Ive become the problem, and I don't have the tools to fix it.





A few years ago, I had a major breakdown.  It was work related.  I suddenly couldnt do my job.  My brain wouldn't allow me to... I couldn't concerntrate, or perform.  I took a month off, in bed, feeling like I wanted to kill myself.  Out of nowhere.  It just came on after a conversation with a work-friend who was doing things with his life.  Building his carreer... doing what I knew I should have been doing and didnt'   It FREAKED me out. Prior to this, I didn't really think these things.  I just coasted and collected my paycheck.   Suddenly I got stuck being fixated on the bad... being jealous of others successes... being fearful of pending doom.  That break made me a different person for sure.   A weaker person.   I'm now receiving therapy & psychotherapy, am on meds for clinical depression and just feel very lost.  The first therapist I met with referred to my life (as I described it) as a big pile of shit... that I had to scrape away at it... but it would not go easily.  I was so offended I went elsewhere, but was he right?



The truly frustrating part is that I've done all of this to myself.   I do have a history of depression in my family.  One grandparent had clinical depression and the others were all pretty removed from friends etc.   So maybe it's not all me.  Maybe I'm becoming who I was destin to become.  But that shouldn't be... I should be in control of my own decisions & outcomes.  I always believed that... so what happend.  I think what happened is that I coasted.  I went with the flow, without having direction.    I now look back at decisions I've made and mistakes that seem so stupid.  So wasteful, and I can't recover from them (financially or emotionally).  I feel like I'm always looking back.  Looking to past mistakes that dictate my current state and my future.   I feel stuck because I chose poorly in the past.. that there's no overcoming the past.  



I've realized that there are so many things that I don't like about my life, and have come to ask WHAT IS THE POINT,  REALLY?    Sure there are good spots here and there, but they are coming much less frequently than they once did.  And they feel far outweighed by the bad.  I've become a bad husband in a damaged marriage.  I've isolated myself from friends and haven't made a single new friend in years.  I feel inept in parenting and work.   I don't really ""enjoy"" doing anything anymore.  I don't laugh, and find smiling harder each day.  I have no disposable income to even try to do thinks I might enjoy.  I truly feel trapped.



So here's the real question.  I'd love to understand why people think suicide is bad.  It sounds like a nice out... being done worrying, done angsting, done being disappointed.  Suicidal thoughts seem logical to me.  It's the fear of how, and the though of disappointing & hurting loved ones that have kept me from seriously exploring it.   This thinking sounds greedy, I know it does, but I feel like others would be ultimately better off.  My life insurance policy is an 1M umbrella for my family, so I know my wife can figure things out and eventually find a new husband... one that treats her better, and really loves her.  My kids are young enough that they'll move on. If I can't support my family financially or emotionally, what good am I?



I realize this is all said in my dark thoughts... but it's where I am.  At this moment, I feel like I truly am lost."
I can't carry on,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-cant-carry-on.122574/,"Things build up over decades until they become unbearable. I feel like I no longer have a heart. I am not mean, I am just cold and numb inside. I don't see a point to this. I am just existing, not living, and none of it is pleasant. I can't take this anymore."
I just wish I had a diagnosis to excuse this...,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-just-wish-i-had-a-diagnosis-to-excuse-this.121980/,"I saw my therapist today... after 16 days... I've really gotten low since I started seeing her in Feb. Because we're digging into a lot of tough things before I am starting DBT...



I had planned on asking her if she thought I was Borderline or something like that... my 'diagnosis' is something along the lines of ""Unspecified disturbance of the personality structure"" if I translate it directly... Apparently that's what they call when I've been harming myself since I was 5, and had suicidal thoughts just as long and can't control my impulses to hurt or kill myself under stress...



But before I ever got to talk about that... she said that thing again she has said so many times... how my 'wrong' behavior makes sense because of how I was brought up.



I feel sick... but according to her I am the result of a life of abuse... She asked me if I thought I could change, both the SH and the anxiety and my avoidance behavior...



I told her I would hope so... but I wasn't sure. I really, really want to live a happy life without all of this.



She also told me something that actually surprised me... she told me no matter what I'd most likely always be afraid... but she hoped to make me considerably less afraid. So... will I always have to look over my shoulder even in broad daylight just in case someone would hurt me??



It hurts... I won't lie. It hurts so bad that it hurts physically. They really broke me.



I don't know if I really had the delusion that I could be completely over everything one day... even if it should take years and years of therapy... but yeah.





Maybe my LDR boyfriend is right... he has been reading up on abused women and rape survivors and what else I have been through... and he told me I was 'amazing' for even trusting him enough to want to meet him.







Why can't it just be a diagnosis that can be medicated and let that be it...





Just... why... why did the world have to be so cruel to me? How can anyone hurt a child???"
My life is Meaningless to Me,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/my-life-is-meaningless-to-me.122402/,"Since last year my life has become meaningless to me for many reasons. I don't really visit this site as much as i use to when i really needed to talk as i felt bad that i am trying to help people, yet in the end i can not help myself. For me i guess i am at current rock bottom or very near it with a somewhat lack of emotions apart from Anger and a little bit of sadness.



Last year i ended up graduating and getting my Bachelors in Information Technology, while this would be an amazing achievement for most people, my feelings were that i failed due to suffering from depression through it all i have forgotten everything i learned and from being so exhausted after 3 years took a big toll on me mentally and physically.



CBT Therapy started last year after almost a year of trouble trying to get help with mental services here where i live. During the time of trying to get the services i had a few troubles with Attempts at Suicide, self harming, Unable to change P-Doctors and bad case management finally broke me to the point of not caring anymore about anything which has ended up sticking with me until now.



My Therapy is every 2 weeks now and we talk about many things to try and find the thing that is causing me to be like this. I find myself telling small lies to him as he asks me why do i bother seeing him if i want to die so badly. The truth is just to keep my family and friends happy as they think things are on the upturn for me when in reality it is no where close. Over the years i have found that talking over problems has very very little affect on me in helping in shape or form.



Medications for me have varied from doing nothing to worse then to somewhat okish, From having bad side affects to not being able to sleep to hearing voices and seeing people. Well the current state of my medications have not been working for along time now and when i ask for a review or a change, i am ignored or saying i haven't given it enough time to kick in. (Been on the same medications for over a year now).



Motivation, Love and mostly Happiness have evaporated from my life. These make any small task feel huge in size and tire me out rather fast while trying to seem happy and hide behind my mask i put up to not show my true self. Things i use to enjoy, now have become a huge struggle to spend more then 5-10 minutes at a time trying to do or work on to the point i give up or become frustrated. Love has become a fantasy for me, which i have lost interest in wanting to be in a relationship even though there is pressure from many people for me to be in one.



There are many other things in my life that have shaped me into the person I am today from my very birth, but i will not go through that as atm this very moment i am numb and really emotionless and couldn't care if i live or die as any hope of getting better slips away while knowing a i am going to have a reaak down within the next month at this rate.



Thank you all. People on SF are wonderful people.

Can't say anything,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/cant-say-anything.122667/,"I'm living in Japan at the moment.

I tried to commit suicide in late February <mod edit> 

Obviously, I failed.

I'm 21 and a student and live alone.

But I haven't talked about it to anyone.

I told people not to visit me in hospital, or if they did come I told them I was in there for a different reason.

I want to talk about it to someone because I've been thinking about doing it again, in a very calm way, and it's starting to scare me.

When I tried last time I remember feeling so calm about everything. I barely even considered what I was doing, I just was switched off and taking a trip down memory lane by myself in a dark room <mod edit>

I want to talk about the way I'm feeling again but I can't even tell people I tried in February because I'm scared it will push my friends and family away, make me seem ungrateful. And then I'll be even more alone. But not telling them I'm also lying to them every day by pretending I'm happy and doing fine and moving forward.

When really I just feel crushed pretty much every day and pathetic and can't beat the mountain of problems I've created for myself in my life.

If I tell my boyfriend will I just freak him out and push him away?

I can't even put this is words but if there's anyone that feels remotely similar, please even share your thoughts with me or if you have any advice....

"Old Member Returns, Suicidal",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/old-member-returns-suicidal.122646/,"I have logged in for the first time in XX years and everything is so radically different. I used to be very active here. In time I grew away from SF for my own wellbeing.



But XX years later, nothing in my life seems to have changed. I've been in therapy and made progress in some things. I've held down jobs. I've worked in the mental health field. I now work outside of mental health as I thought that may help me get away from these negative thoughts. I've done quite well for myself materially. On a CV I look like my life is sorted.



But I'm 37, single and deeply unhappy. Tomorrow I am going to resign from my job as it's causing me too much stress. I don't have a job to go to. There have been times in my life when I've seen glimmers of hope. Hope that I could function in this world. But time after time things remind me these are unachievable dreams. 



I used to belong here. I used to have purpose and hope. Now all I can see is <insert graphic image of my suicide here>. I'm empty and hopeless. This post doesn't even give details of why this has come about, because quite frankly who would read it or care. My hope is that if someone goes through my internet history they'll come across this post and get a brief inkling of how unhappy I feel."
I still don't know.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-still-dont-know.122351/,"So here I am again... a year and a half later and I'm still struggling with this shit. I escaped my abusive parents, found a good job, and am on yet another boyfriend. This one's legit, I swear! (I'm only saying that because he's reading over my shoulder). So yeah, I wrote a suicide note last night. I was ready to walk out the door, install myself <edit - methods>. Then I shredded the note and climbed into bed with my man, told him what was happening and we cried for a few hours before falling asleep, exhausted. I apologized profusely this morning but this afternoon I locked myself in a room and started <edit - methods>. Noisily. For attention? Maybe. It really just felt good to know I was damaging myself though. More hysteric crying, more feeling empty, more deep, dark, all-consuming despair. I'm just sick of this. Sick of it all. I refuse to go on meds. I refuse to see a professional. I don't want to get better, and so it's no use trying. Everyone seems to want something from me in the chaos following my divorcing my parents, and I can't handle it. It really is an excess of stress that triggers these feelings; I know it is. And I can handle a lot of stress. Life has been so crazy recently...



I really feel that it's time for me to actually do it, but I know it's a shitty idea. As long as I'm alive at least I have a choice. Maybe I'll just run away to Italy... anyways"
How do you cope with life being laughably unfair?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/how-do-you-cope-with-life-being-laughably-unfair.122742/,"Everyday at work I get confronted with people who live life on complete easy mode. They never had any sort of struggle in their lives and probably never will experience any struggle or adversity. Itå«s their birth right to experience the best things life has to offer. Meanwhile my life is the complete opposite. Nothing ever comes easy and I always lose despite putting in 1000 times more effort into things. 



Being a loser in life sucks and makes me extermely suicidal. Everyday I feel like a starving African kid who is being chained to a table full of the finest dishes the world has to offer, but Iå«m not allowed to touch anything. Iå«m being forced to watch everybody else gorge the food down. Everyday, over and over again.

I want it to end,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-want-it-to-end.122627/,"There are many times where I wanted to commit suicide, I cannot feel any hope anymore. The pain is unbearable. I'm only fifteen, and here I am, having the same thought again. My parents all blame stuff on me, they never really cared about how I feel. My mother wanted to kill me, but was stopped by my brother, she actually brought in the knife to my room ready to strike, I'm so scared. I just want this pain to go away. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is unavailable right now, and I have never felt so helpless, I just want to end it all, then I don't have to feel the pain anymore.

Last night, I had an argument with my mother, it started off quite nice, since I have to do whatever they say, my dad called me to scrub the toilet and I did, but my mum doesn't like the idea, and she scold me for not telling her what my dad had asked me to do. Then she went on accusing the things that I haven't done - stealing, harming her physically. But I know she had done those things, she had beat me on a regular basis, but I was to cowardly to turn to anyone for help.



I tried to ignore them, just to exist a bit longer, but I guess it is time when it has to end, I know they wanted it to since they have starved me for the whole day. they haven't allowed me to eat or drink anything for the whole day, the reason I am able to enter this help site is because I have hid my laptop and phone and wallet under my pillow all the time.

During the 'happier' times I never feel at peace and there is always my depression shadow lurking over my shoulder just waiting for a trigger. And this trigger could be absolutely anything.



But over the past 2 years however, I can't shift it. Nothing is bringing me out of this deep dark well in which I now lurk.



While I know many people, I don't have friends because I don't allow anyone to know the real me. They get the authorised version, the acceptable one. This past week has been the worst of my life.

A life ruined and left with no hope,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/a-life-ruined-and-left-with-no-hope.121889/,"I want to start out saying I am sorry to hear about everyones problems and struggles.  I am not sure how much I am comfortable with writing down but I will try to at least get some basics.

    I have ruined my life, not one event but almost all events that just keep spiraling down hill, everytime I think I hit bottom I fly off a cliff and down another mountain. I am not talking about drugs or anything of that nature.

    I am 33 years old and have been married over 10 years, with no kids. I have no job (for over 3 years),no income, no car, and absolutely nothing my name. My wife suffers from PNES and can't work because of the seizures, we are trying to get her on Social Security but she has no income either. We live with her mom who has paid and continues to pay for everything for us over the last 7 years. I have a culinary degree but owe tons of money in loans that are in default.

     I was committed into a psych ward for suicide 8 years ago for 4 days. They were so quick to say bipolar but after a few years of none of the bipolar meds working even maxed out they ruled against bipolar and went with anxiety disorder with ocd but prescribed me nothing and took all the pills away.

    I then proceed to ruin my life and my wifes life. I was locked up for almost 3 years. While I was down my wife cheated on me but just told me 2 months ago after being back over 3 years. I know I messed up because I have to pay for it everyday for the rest of my life.

    I can't get work because of the nature of my crime and I can't qualify for government assistance. I am essentially a diseased mutt waiting for the day when he will be put down.  I have to beg for everything and I have to sit by while my wifes condition gets worse.  

    There are so many days that go by that I regret not going through with my suicide instead of getting help.  My crime stims from childhood and if I would have seeked helped about it, I would have just been locked up sooner.      I have no hope for the future, all my dreams crushed or impossible, I am leech and a monster.  If this was a place negative comments where allowed, I would have hundreds saying to go through with it and just end it.  Believe me I think and ask for death everyday, is this the day it can end, is this the day a vigilante will finally end me.  I live a waking hell and wish my life on no one, not even my worst enemies. 

   The only small thread that is keeping hanging on is my wife but it is a small thread that gets pulled tighter by the day and maybe only a matter of time before it snaps and then then I will make society happy, because I will be permnantly gone.

Extreme bullying growing up, had an abusive father and an alcoholic mother and I was always unattractive to women because of my unattractive face. None of this was my fault. I got dealt a terrible hand in this life and I always tried to make the most of it, but nothing ever changes. Suicide seems logical and rational. Looking back itå«s amazing how little control we have over lives. 



Iå«m 27 and feel like I have absolutely maximized my potential and the results are still extremely unsatisfactory and Iå«m left with a life that is not worth living. 



From here on out things will only get worse the older I get so I see no point in continuing to drag myself through this living hell."

No morality,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/no-morality.122143/,"i have a desire to commit suicide but it's much more than that. I have no morality anymore. Maybe that's not the right word ,feel free to correct me if it isn't. I don't care if the people around me suffer or how they feel or anything along those lines. And that goes for my friends and family as well. I'm not sure if it's a bad thing but it's just how I feel. To put it in a scenario, I currently go to class and I know school/university shootings are thought of as a terrible thing, but I don't think it would bother me at all if that were to happen to the school I attend. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't do it myself or help the cause but I don't think I would care much if I saw that happening all before my eyes. Sure it would mean suffering for my friends and I would prefer them to make it out of that situation unharmed physically and mentally, but it wouldn't bother me all to much. As for those who aren't close to me I wouldn't have even the slightest care for. I just don't care what happens to anyone around me anymore, or myself either to be honest. I would probably attempt to survive out of instinct at the time but I looking at it now and after the event itself it would mean nothing to me. I wouldn't feel bad for those who lost their lives and those who lost their loved ones. This is probably due to the fact that I feel I've dealt with an unfair amount of pain throughout my life and I feel it isn't fair that everyone else isn't experiencing the same pain as I am. Without doubt I am depressed but I think it's worse then that. I don't feel bad for the unfortunate nor do I care about those around me. If everyone were to drop dead around me I feel I wouldn't have any problem with it at all. As far as my own life I don't care much about that either. If I were to die today or tomorrow it wouldn't bother me the slightest. I'm not a huge fan of this place (being the world). I joke a lot about suicide and other terrible things to those around me and some believe I'm just joking and others wonder how I could say such terrible things. The truth is I just don't care. Sure that may make me a bad person but so what, what do I gain out of being a good person. I tried that already and all I got was a lot of pain. So why not be a bad person. I don't neccisarally want to hurt everyone around me (except those who have hurt me, which I want nothing but revenge so badly it hurts), it's more like I just don't care if everyone has to suffer. I wouldn't stop the suffering even if I could. What would I gain from that? Whenever you help others all that comes with it is pain down the road. And as for those who have hurt me I want to cause an unfathomable amount of pain to. Not the same amount that was inflicted upon me, a lot more. I don't want to play to get fair, I want to play to win and to hurt. Earlier I said I don't want people to hurt I just don't care if they do, that may be wrong now that I think about it. Maybe I do just want to cause everyone around me the same pain I feel, I just don't know how to go about it. And ending a life other than my own isn't something I am interested in. I'm not a killer, also I'd rather have them feel constant pain throughout their lives until they hate it just as much as I do. I don't think of myself as a bad person in anyway for having these thoughts although a lot of people may. And even if I came to the conclusion that I was a bad person bc of this, nothing would change bc I don't have a problem with being a terrible person Why would I?

I'm A Failure,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/im-a-failure.122633/,"No matter what I do I feel like a failure. 



I've had an eating disorder for a while now and whenever I eat I feel like I'm a failure, but whenever I don't eat I feel like I'm letting down my friends when they tell me I should eat. They tell me I'm really skinny but I just don't see it. To me, I look fat. 



I'm really insecure about myself. I'm scared to walk out in public because I hate the way I look. I hate how I'm too shy to speak to people, I hate how it takes me ages to make a friend (and even then they do more talking than me) I hate how I compare myself to others and think how much of a mistake I am. I hate how no matter what people say to me or do to help me: I always think and feel like no-one cares about me. I'm scared to reach out on my sleepless nights to my friends that say they are here for me. I feel like I'm bothering them or I can't fight my own battles because I'm too weak.



 I used to get top marks in one of my classes every week when we did our weekly test but now I've gone down to C's, D's,E's and F's and I feel like a failure because I'm not getting the grades I used to. Recently I got my report back and found that some of my grades are lower than some people's grades who are in lower classes than me.



Whenever I SH I feel free and I get a sensation that makes me feel human but I feel like I've failed everyone, especially when I'm asked to show them my arms, but if I don't SH I feel like I'm too wimpy and too much of a failure to do anything. 



I hate how I'm so quiet and shy that people pick on me as they know I won't try to defend myself.I've had  humiliating rumours spread about me. I've been called names. I've had my things stolen. I've been pushed. I've been nearly shoved down a flight of stairs. I've had things put in my hair. I've had things thrown at me and I feel like a failure that, not once, have I stood up for myself. I've just sat alone and cried and soaked up every negative thing anyone has said or done to me and let it eat me alive.



When I cry I feel like a failure because I can't just hold it in any longer.



I feel like a failure all the nights I've been up, not being able to sleep, just breaking down over worrying about going to school or completing the simplest of tasks. I'm even scared to ask for a new textbook or even to walk into assembly.



Today, for the first time I tried to make myself purge and (I know it's not pleasant, I'm sorry) but I can't get the feeling out of my system the minute I started gagging. I wasn't successful but now I wish I was.



I've been told that I'm not a failure. But I know I am. I hate feeling like this but I hate myself and everything about myself. I just can never find to pick out something I like about myself."
Having a job doesn't help.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/having-a-job-doesnt-help.121862/,"I think about my tinnitus all day at work. All I can think about is ending it. I don't want to learn anything new, I don't talk to anybody. I thought that if I had a distraction, if I contributed to society, that I'd be better. But I'm not. In fact, I'm worse. Luckily it was a temp job and it's ending soon, but my boss actually wanted me to stay. I told her no, that I was too unhealthy to work (I also have interstitial cystitis as well as depression and anxiety. The worst part about this is that my mother works at the same company and wants me to work there with her but when I try to explain, she doesn't want to hear it. She thinks this is her fault, but it's not. Although, my parents did suggest I stop taking ADs (after 9 years of doing so), and I followed suit, stopping them three months ago only to now contract two horrible diseases, tinnitus and interstitial cystitis. Too bad they are not life-threatening.



I've never been a go-getter. I did try for four years to get a voiceover career going, because acting is all I'm good at and all I've ever wanted to do. I wanted to do voices in cartoons, videogames, and anime. But I spent all this money on equipment, a teacher, and online services and it wasn't worth it. I never wanted to do anything, really, just sit and watch anime or play videogames. I can't do those things in peace anymore. The T just follows me everywhere I go.

my story...so tired of this shit,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/my-story-so-tired-of-this-shit.122050/,"I dont know if i ever put my whole story down....begining to end. the best i can do is summarize as there is alot of pain i do not wish to relive. My life changed one day at the age of 27...I am now 41. I was at the cusp of full independence within arms reach of seizing almost everything major I wanted to get out of life. 

I was 3/4 through my internship, was talking to another intern who was pretty cool and quite beautiful, there seemed to be mutual interest in each other. Then within a month and a half everything was taken from me. The handyman job that supported me through college went out of business and now the internship which offered me a job was my last hope. (i was an unpaid intern with a month left to go). 

A position was being created for me in the new sales division after my performance in several key assignments and the steady course of the semester. But some asshole had to become jealous. Instead they felt entitled to the position and proceeded to sabotage me and make the work environment hostile towards me. He got into both private and work email addresses, erased business messages, switched office supplies so I assembled the mailers incorrectly, turned the small office against me saying i was making more than them. there's more but it's too hurtful to go into

Long story short i had a meltdown......i was so stressed i was eating right, sleeping right, couldn't take care of myself well and did things like come to work late inspite of trying to fight back against him. He would talk about me in round about tones that it made me paranoid. Would do things to taunt me. Eventually I would get a pyschotic break. I could literally feel something in my brain like a myelene sheathe rip or something...(i know there is no myelene sheath in the brain). This would lead to me losing the internship, my mind, my apartment, my future, my love interest and all of my savings."

I can't find a job, I have no money. I'm sorta going blind and my partner seems to not really see that I'm struggling while he has a job, is getting a new one starting soon, gives his mother money. Provides for his dog(his baby) and not our cat. I love him but am sorta falling out due to all this drama with him. But I want to stay and make it work. There's a long list of other things but I don't want to bore anyone. I feel like me leaving this world is the only thing I can think off.

My PCP is up the street, so I went there and asked why the fuck they'd give me a referral for an office that doesn't take my insurance.

Help,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/help.122073/,"two weeks ago totally out of the blue my boyfriend of two years broke up with me saying he can't cope with his depression anymore (the first is heard of it) and needed to take a step back from our relationship which I understood as I have PTSD and knew what he needed right now was me as a friend and for a week or so we were good friends but the past few days he's been out taking drugs with a group of ""mates"" all who take hard drugs and want to sleep with him it's killing me. When he goes out with them not answering his phone to anyone, so I've had to go over to his house which at first he is annoyed by but then seems grateful for and back to his normal self. However last night I stayed with him because he said he wants to kill himself and he was fine we watched a movie and he became himself again and woke up the same but around two he had an argument with his mum and he just snapped again told me he never liked me and just wants everyone to leave him alone so he can die I tried to get him to come with me to get help but he adamantly refused and punched a wall. He's gone out to meet these ""mates"" of his and I'm terrified he won't come home. I've been in touch with his mum and were both trying to find him but I have no idea what I can do to help him right now because I still love him so much and everything he says I know he doesn't mean but it hurts so much.What should I do?

Life just feels too much,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/life-just-feels-too-much.122079/,"A friend of mine posted a meme the other day and tagged me, it was of a little girl saying 'I feel really, really happy right now...I wonder what will fuck me up next'. Although I chuckled it is kind of how I experience life, except I have not felt really happy in years. But things can be going well, or at least not badly and I allow myself to look at the future and think of positive things and feel a little bit hopeful then something devastating happens. 

I felt like this at New Year's then on the 5th of January one of my kitties suddenly died, no idea what even from and only 8. My kitties are my reasons to live and is like losing a child to me, I can't stop crying about it. Since then it feels like things are snowballing, 5 other kitty illnesses, all unrelated, with my current sick baby, my eldest, 17, really unwell, am so worried about her and terrified of losing her. I feel like I live at the vets! This year I am meant to be moving house, I know people say it i stressful but I had no idea how much and that it could all still fall through, my anxiety is through the roof. 

I was recently sexually assaulted by a neighbour and am scared to even go out, though I have to to work. I have been single for two years now and am so sick of i, being alone all the time. I have a couple of friends but you know how it is not the same, being nearly 40 and single really sucks. Then my car got towed from a place we have always been allowed to park, they put up a tiny temporary sign, so more money to pay out, thought was stolen so was very stressful. Then a bailiff turned up at my door! People I pay charges to for my business have miscalculated the amount, I have chased them up about it to work out the right amount, last they said was it is all fine and they are sorting it, then a bailiff turns up saying I owe them 1250 Euros, so they still have not sorted it or told the people who collect the money so now have to try to sort that. Stupid things like the parcel man has left a parcel at the shop where I got assaulted, have not been back since and now have to go knowing the man is always there at the cafe and then kids kicked a football hitting my shoulder while carrying sick kitty in a box. Stupid problems at work with boilers and internet not working etc and people making it hard for me to sort out. 

It just feels like some really, traumatic big things mixed with lots of little things are making me feel like I am hanging on by a thread and just waiting for the next thing to fuck me over. I feel like I would rather die than deal with facing any of it. But I have my kitties, who I saved and could not leave so they save me from suicide too. But then I feel trapped here. The main thing keeping me going is moving but if I lose the place, it is in an area where it could be years until something in my budget and I am scared to stay in this neighbourhood now as the harassment is almost every day, the men here have no respect for women. It's all just too much and feels like I am going to explode."
How do I get out of a stump?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/how-do-i-get-out-of-a-stump.121978/,"I know there is no concrete answer to this question or none of us would be on this forum right now.... but my depression and anxiety are preventing me from completing the most mundane tasks. I was told I was anemic in August.. got routine bloodwork monthly and my Hemoglobin rose a point but I am still slightly anemic. My hemoglobin went down again last month to 9.7--it is not dietary related as my iron/B6 levels have been normal consistently. Maybe I am this fatigued from the anemia???? But I think it is the depression too. 

My dad has been depressed and anxious all his life. He managed to have a successful career for the past 35+ years but recently his depression got the best of him leading him to turn to opiates for the past eight years (unbeknownst to my family). In July he wad admitted to a 60k facility which bled us dry of all our money so we are struggling financially. In October my Dad returned home and decided to quit his job on disability leaving us with no income and NO health insurance. Meanwhile, my brother decides to steal 15k worth of equipment and valuables and pawn them off from September to February (UNBEKNOWNST to my Mom..see a pattern here? She's very naive and only sees the best in people and is in a constant state of denial) So her being the momma bear she is doesn't press charges. So now we have two recovering addicts and now my dad lays around all day in his BOXERS with food stains all over his shirt refusing to get off the couch and I swear he is going to get bed sores from not moving. He watches movies all day and complains of how hopeless and depressed he feels. Well I feel just as bad at him yet I am in my senior semester of college and have come the far so I might as well tough it out until May. BUT...HOW DO I GET GRADUATE IF I CANNOT EVEN GO TO CLASS? I just got off on a tangent but I am feeling crazy right now stuck in my thoughts with no one to talk to. I could drive home but the sight of my Dad deteriorating on that couch just triggers me to be even more depressed. I have a case study for one of my classes (Renal disorders/diseases) and it requires a ton of critical thinking and my brain is just shut off and I don't know how I am going to look through all the lab numbers and criteria come up with a diagnosis and intervention when I am SO FREAKIN tired and unable to do anything let alone shower or feed myself. I literally lay in my room all day and live off saltines because I don't want to leave my room to cook. I watch netflix for 12+ hours until it gets dark and then I go to bed. I only leave the house to go to my boyfriends but I don't even want to see him anymore because I'm this depressed and I have no desire to do ANYTHING. I have no desire to go anywhere or get up out of this bed. I wish I could go into a coma for 50+ years. I wish this would all go away but I can't leave this earth because I'm the only one my mom has. It's against my beliefs to commit suicide and I know ending my life is not the answer because it's a PERMANENT solution to a temporary problem. But I guess its cathartic to dream of a way out of this mess and a way to escape my thoughts for once. I'm trapped inside my head and it's giving me a panic attack that I can't shut my thoughts off when I need to function today. The more I type the more I panic because I realize how debilitated and pathetic my life has become. 

Anyone who has ever been this depressed, how did you get out of it???! (if you decided to not read my rant I don't blame you, but I would appreciate hearing anyone's experiences with similar issues and how they managed to get through it)"

Me, my heart, my soul, all that I am wish now for it all to be over. When pain outweighs suffering it's time. I'm not even frightened anymore I just don't have the strenght to heal my heart again."
the last straw,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/the-last-straw.122203/,"Hi,

My mind is a mess,after 20 years of being with an abusive partner,emotionally and physically ,raising our kids almost single handedly,   and dealing with her cheating,

I have no life no friends just emptiness inside.

Not a day goes by where I don't think about taking my life,one failed attempt already.

I am now ready to try again as its the only way I see."
The thoughts are here...,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/the-thoughts-are-here.122173/,"Those horrible thoughts are here and I'm so tired of suffering. Right now my eyes hurt so much, they're burning and I have a migraine too. I'm about to take something for it soon. I've been posting a lot lately cause I'm emotional and I tend to get very sensitive by things.



Today I was talking to a friend of mine online, he knows how I feel about him and he knows I love him but he won't say ""I love you."" He's moody right now and down which I understand, but does that honestly stop you from saying, I love you? I have no idea.....maybe I'm just expecting him to say it. He said I'm very special to him today though, I feel his love for me is nothing more than a friends but yet he yet he says, ""not only are you doubting what I felt/feel/will feel for you but also doubting my friendship and everything I did for you and for both of us.""



I feel like he's stating the truth and than another part of me doesn't believe him cause I suffer with lots of trauma in my life and I want to be happy. I'm sorry for those who I upset but I'm in a horrible mind set right now and I can't think straight and why is it anytime I'm heart broken or crushed or thinking a guy doesn't love me makes me I suddenly think like this? A part of me is is wanting to let this go and forget about him all together and never talk to him anymore. However the good side of me says, I'm being paranoid and I should start loving myself and work on my thought process a little better. What do you think??"
My husband took his life and im pregnant.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/my-husband-took-his-life-and-im-pregnant.122495/,My husband took his life a little over a month ago. I was in the shower and found him in the garage. I am 5 months pregnant with our second child and it has not gotten any easier. Anytime I think it is starting to I fall apart again and I'm tired of being in this much pain. All it took was 20 minutes to shower and get ready. All it took was turning that corner. I tried to save him.. but had to take him off life support that night. He died 4 times in front of me. I can't live with this anymore.

Suicidal at 22,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/suicidal-at-22.122405/,"hi, I'm new here. this is possibly my last resort to seeking help. my family has a history of mental illness, my mother is bipolar and has become severely depressed these last few years. I was diagnosed with depression back in 2013, I am 22 years old now. after a nasty phase of excessive partying and doing drugs, I decided to turn my life around. three years later and I still have these terrible thoughts. since I was younger, I've dealt with low self esteem, cutting and even contemplating death. I always figured those were just typical 'teenager' feelings. but as I got older, the thought of hurting myself became more apparent. it's like having a demon constantly whisper in your ear that you're scum, a piece of shit. I'll never amount to anything. I try endlessly to block these thoughts out, I try to read a book, meditate, nothing works. the more alone I am with my thoughts, the more I want to listen to that little voice in the back of my head. the thing is, I want to die. I've already decided how and when I want to leave. I would like to wait until my parents leave this world first, because I could never hurt them. I would never put them through that, losing a child. but it gets harder to live each day. I love my parents so much and I am only here for them. however, the more I want to die, the harder it is to fight. my boyfriend doesn't understand mental illness, I don't expect him to. he expects me to just 'be okay'. like this shit has an off switch...i understand it is difficult being with someone with mental illness. which makes me feel even more low, I know he can find someone better, normal too. I am not happy with him anymore because I cannot be happy myself. I have become too clingy because i need constant reassuring that I am still loved. I am turning our relationship into a toxic one. no one wants to be with someone like that. I need help, I refuse to take pills and go to a doctor who views me as just another prescription. i want to love myself and know that I have more to live for, but I don't. I just wish to die soon, so I could be free from myself."
"I feel so trapped! Constant pain, but can end it due to my kids!",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-feel-so-trapped-constant-pain-but-can-end-it-due-to-my-kids.122771/,"I have severe medical conditions/Injuries that have left me in constant pain. If it's not severe pain in my lower back, it's severe nerve pain in my hips, groin, behind my knees and down the backs of my lower legs. I find it hard to deal with. I'm only in my mid 40's yet my ability to get about matches that of an 80-90 year old!! Over the years it has dragged me down mentally and physically. I take allsorts of strong meds like morphine and Fentanyl. I've researched this and tried and had support from groups I've taken part in as best I could.

I tried suicide several times, some 15+ years ago, when I was very mentally unstable, and it was before my back problems and surgeries to try and fix the problem had started, and the chronic pain had started. The reason I feel trapped is I can't end my life due to the hurt I would cause my children and wife. I love them more than anything in the world, And having been in Law Enforcement, I know the pain suffered by those who are left behind.  I think they may learn to live with it eventually.....? After all, I'm only a burden to my wife for instance for many reasons. To name but a few, I'm no use when it comes to helping her with the physical work I used to do around the house and garden. Watching her pressure clean the patio, then mow our lawns, is so demoralising and depressing for me. The trouble is If I ended my life, I just can't be sure they would get over it and move on in life ok. Especially my daughter, who is mentally fragile, and already takes anti-depression tablets.  I'm just physically and mentally worn out by the physical pain, and the rest of the misery that comes with it. Being miserable and dragging my wife down, protesting when the kids ask for some help with something, when all I want to do is lye down and ease the pain. I recently went on a Psychological course, on how to deal with the constant drain being in constant pain causes. Clearly it didn't work! I constantly wish a terminal illness would strike me down, or hope I get involved in a road crash. I understand that's the easy way out. But the last few days have really taken there toll on me....... 

Anyway, that's enough bleating about my problems....."
the right thing,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/the-right-thing.122242/,"lately, i've been reading (here and elsewhere) of people's experiences at the brink of self-destruction when they were brought back from the edge by something.  in some cases, it was the intervention of a loved one, or the timely plea of a pet, or even just a stranger's kind word.  i have come to recognize from these that there is some higher power -- whatever you put your faith in . . . a god if you are religious, or karma, or just the universe -- that intercedes to keep safe those souls or spirits.  looking at my life through an objectively critical and analytical lens, i can see clearly that i have lots and lots of reasons to keep fighting and to stay here.  but i know that i no longer have the desire . . . seeing the absolute mess that i have made of my life, the disasters i have imposed upon the lives of everyone who matters, everyone about whom i care, i know that my selfish reasons for wanting to continue to be here, to be alive, don't amount to anything.  i should not be here, and whatever strength i had to keep up the fight is sapped entirely by the recognition that, by leaving now, i do not necessarily make amends to those around me who i have harmed, but at least the damage is stayed and maybe things become easier for them.  isn't that enough of a reason to do the right thing?  isn't that a good enough excuse for going along with the screams of every cell within me that just wants to finally give up?"
12 years ago,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/12-years-ago.122263/,"I just realized what today was. 



12 years ago I was 14... 12 years ago is the day I officially mark as the day I became a fan of Michael Jackson... 



But... the thing is... that was also one of the times I had a very serious suicide attempt planned. I had 3 methods lined up even... I was realizing begging the angels to take me away wasn't enough any more... 



It hurts so bad to know I got to that point... I have been suicidal since I was 9 years ago... but this was one of my worst attempts. 



It was around 6 months after I was brutally raped... I had suffered in silence... pregnancy scares, horrible nightmares, meeting my rapist over and over again... he would find me on busses, sit next to me, pressed against me... always looking over my shoulder... on top of everything I was heavily bullied in school and my mum was abusive... and the reason I finally had enough was that I was forced to attend my rapist's birthday celebration. I couldn't wiggle myself out of it... mum would have dragged me there by my hair if I tried to refuse. 



I was home alone that night... and everything was on the table in front of me. I was so numb. I hadn't even bothered writing a letter... I felt like no-one would care anyway. 



My life was saved though... and I'm happy it was. I know my life isn't the best... but I'm getting there... I had the TV on, I have a phobia of silence. 

They were showing the movie 'Moonwalker' that evening. It starts with these serene tunes as Man in The Mirror starts playing. It broke through my numbness somehow and I sat there frozen, staring at the screen... and I did for the full duration of the film. I didn't even move... and I feel like I didn't even blink. 



As the credits rolled I found out I was smiling. I couldn't remember the last time I had done that. I put away the methods... I went to bed that night humming some of his songs... and an MJ fan was born. 

I made a lot of friends in that fandom... sadly since he died the fandom got a bit strange and so many things changed... I haven't been on a fan board in so, so long. His music, videos and concerts still bring me joy though... but it's not the same since he died. Most days I can't stand listening to 'Man In The Mirror'... because that's the song they played as they carried his casket out. I grieved his death so badly. 



I even have a tattoo dedicated to him. It turned out so ugly though... the artist messed it up. And the concept is really weird... but I wasn't thinking too clearly when I got it. It's the outline of a black heart on my wrist, and the letters 'MJ' (which is also a shortened version of my real name) in red, and blood dripping down my arm from them. 





Thank you Michael, for keeping me alive."

Where I live you have to get on the highway to get everywhere, and that right now is too much for me to handle. I know the temptation to hurt/kill myself while driving is there. It is so scary. The way I feel now is very scary. I almost feel as though I am dead inside, walking around not really knowing where I am going or what I am doing.  I have been chain smoking cigarettes and it is making my chest burn, but I like the feeling. I have never cut myself before, but I am considering it now. Lately I have just wanted to hurt myself and cause myself pain. Maybe it will make me feel like I can feel something again? I'm frustrated. I have done a lot of counseling already and I just can't seem to get better. Is there something wrong with me? I must be fucked up in the head to feel like this constantly, unable to find happiness and always beating myself up. I almost feel like I hate myself for being like this. I want out."

Three years of happiness dumped,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/three-years-of-happiness-dumped.121838/,"So after three fantastic, happy and absolutely incredible years my now ex-girlfriend has left me. Because as she said, she does not feel any passion anymore and she is tired. Not even sure of the true reason though.

However I know one thing, that she was meant to be the one to me. This crisis of mine began about three months ago, when she showed the first signs of wanting to break it all up. Then the first thoughts of suicide appeared. 

I began writing secret letters so that I would be able to see my progress. Progress of my emotions and psychological well being. It just got worse everyday. I even managed to make a plan for my last trip. I have written a lot of letters including the goodbye ones. I now have a full plan of how it all will end.

The thing that hurts me the most is the fact that all of those three years of Love, has turned out to be a lie. I cannot cope with the fact that my world, which was planned around Her only, has turned around 180 degrees.

So many things I did for her, so much time that I have spent for her. She was my priority. I even had to lie sometimes to my family so I would be able to spend more time with her and surprise her. I gave her everything. I spent so much money on our happiness. So much time and effort, so many ideas that I worked out, many travels around the country and even more crazy ideas that I have managed to think off in order to make her smile, make her laugh.

Another thing I cannot deal with is the fact that I have to realize, that she will be with someone else. She will do things that I always wanted to do with someone else. Someone else will kiss her and do all the things we did or would do. Honestly, I feel jealious. Jealious for whoever is going to communicate with her. Who Will be with Her. I know that the pain I feel is temporary right now. But I know for a fact that I will always be jealious and I will always feel that I am missing something inside of me. Therefore, this is something I cannot deal with, something I do not want to live with. I must make that feeling go away. Make all of those feelings go away and feel absolutely nothing. 

Every single step that I take in this world reminds me of her. Every sound, every song, every look and every place. I know way too much of the things she loves and hates. I know too many details about her interests.

My mistake was that I planned my whole life around her. There was not a single action I did without considering her feelings, any possible impact on her and her opinion. I was absolutely sure she will be my wife and that the things I did would be something that would make our future bright.

I was wrong. All three years went to dump. And now I find that fact hard to deal with. And I feel too much, way too much, that is why I keep getting the thoughts of ending it all."

But I get these suicidal thoughts in my head... how easy it would be to do this and that... and it doesn't seem like I worry about the consequences. 



I have been listening to Prince all night, while visiting my mum this weekend I found my old CD's in her attics... and there's this line in a song that goes ""Life is just a party, and parties aren't meant to last""... I felt like I was agreeing... 



My logic brain wants me to live, I want to fight. I want to be here for the future when my boyfriend can move here and we can build all the things I never had... 



I just worry myself... 



I have two sides of my brain... and like I explained to my therapist it's a near constant battle between the two... 



There's the logic grown up one, who is trying to get better, and do all the right things... 

And there's the purely emotional part, that just wants to scream and throw stuff and hurt my body to get all these horrible emotions out. It's this part that acts first when I'm met with triggers and bad memories... 



My therapist has instructed me to think of the logic side as a parental figure that needs to hug the emotional side, tell them that they understand and validate these emotions, but try to steer into a safe direction... 



But yeah... it feels like my logic brain is still sedated."
Had a nightmare,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/had-a-nightmare.122219/,"This morning, I woke up from a nightmare. In my dream, I was all alone, no support, no friends and no family. For 25 years I did absolutely nothing and my life was pathetic and a waste. In the end, I had zero confidence as I watched others go about their lives smoothly minding their own business as usual and having all love, warmth and comfort from close people. And, here I was, a nobody, an invisible man. Even after my suicide, there was no funeral, and nobody bothered or cared to look down at my dead body. They all passed by as If I had never existed.

I thought about this for a while, and realized how this nightmare is pretty much my life thus far.

I need help, I have been feeling horrible inside for years. I haven't had a day where I was happy."

Feeling done.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/feeling-done.122388/,"To think that I was worrying about what I would talk about with my counselor at my next appointment. Today, what set me off just moments ago was a professor's invitation to a group of us who will be part of her clinic next year to have drinks at a bar. But while I had been expecting the email today, I was expecting it hours earlier, not just barely two hours before she wanted to meet up. I have been trying to do my work but unsuccessfully, reading the same pages while in my mind I've been justifying why I can't go. To ""normal"" people, it's like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but to me, I feel overwhelmed, ashamed, and resentful. I don't like drinking really, I don't know the other students in my clinic, I hate how disorganized this professor is, and how little she seems to value our time by repeatedly doing this to us. I appreciate her efforts to reach out, but it just makes me feel crappy for all my personality traits. Why do I have to create an excuse to get out of it. Why can't I just say no and let that be that?



Why do I struggle over these trivial matters that really don't matter in the grand scheme of things? What is the point of suffering like this? Sometimes, I think I'm a masochist based on past choices and that I sabotage myself because I just can't help myself. But I genuinely just want it to be all over. I fantasize about stumbling upon the perfect opportunity to take something and have it be done in a painless instant. I don't care that it won't look like an accident. I have no qualms about the morality of suicide, despite my religious beliefs. I don't understand why I'm here and it'd just be easier for everyone if I wasn't. I think I do have everything I need if I really wanted to make that choice, but I am not certain that it will be irrevocably effective and definitely not painless. I need certainty. If I am going to try, I am damn well going to succeed. I can't bear the irony of failing a suicide attempt. It would drive me actually insane. Sometimes, I wish something would happen to me to give me legitimate reasons to take the next step, but for now I am just pretending, existing, hating it, and wishing I wasn't me."
Why not?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why-not.122692/,"I am really scared because I feel like I could easily go over the edge. I can't think of any reasons not to do it.

I've been on this site for six years.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/ive-been-on-this-site-for-six-years.121950/,"I joined when I was 13, and hardly even thought about making it to graduating high school since I was so caught up in wanting to just die.

In those six years, I've attempted suicide twice, I've self harmed, I've been sent to inpatient treatment for an eating disorder, and I've used enough drugs I think my parents would disown me if they knew of my experience in that area. But, I've also graduated high school, completed half of my undergraduate degree a year early while on a path to a masters degree, and I've recovered from the previously mentioned eating disorder. I have an internship secured for the summer and I've got a solid plan for my future and the goals I want to achieve.

Last November, I was diagnosed with PTSD, as well as my previous diagnoses of depression and anxiety. To put it bluntly, that fucked me up. It made me realize how much my upbringing has affected my mental health and these past six months have been particularly difficult.

I know I've hardly been on this site anymore, but I seem to have hit a wall and sometimes it still feels like killing myself is the only option I have anymore. It's affecting my everyday life and my academics and I just feel trapped and I don't know who to talk to or how to deal with it anymore."

Is suicide a valid option?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/is-suicide-a-valid-option.122433/,"Every single day, I try to change my situation. So far, there has been no progress. I am isolated. I have always been isolated since birth. Tried to find a reason why I am extremely alienated. Couldn't find anything. So what the hell is wrong with me? What did I do to deserve such misfortunes?



I do my best, put on a smile. Inside I feel nothing but agony. It occurred to me yesterday, that maybe my heart is telling me to die. Maybe because I may be of no use and no matter what I try,  I will always be a sore loser who will always be talentless and friendless . Makes a lot of sense, since I have no passion or drive to excel.

I cannot bear this existence any longer. I have been emotionally scarred and to make it even worse, I still have absolutely nobody to talk to."
I did a dumb thing,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-did-a-dumb-thing.122130/,"and researched methods, and watched/researched method of choice on youtube and google. and now i feel much much worse, i want to stop that feeling. it has brought me back to those few times i went ""out there"" to do it . . . and i keep think it will fail, won't work, and then there would be humungous police business and stuff being in the spotlight



being behind the computer screen and researching is nothing like going out there and being poised to do it at that very moment with the very real aspect of failing and going home/being discovered, and dealing with the aftermath, and psychological traumatization. 



and is not so much that i actually want to die but to change the situation."
Everything has been a waste,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/everything-has-been-a-waste.122486/,"I am tired of trying things over and over. As I have posted here before, I took all of the suggestions into account. Joined clubs, helped volunteer. I still felt isolated and it wasn't because of me. If you were in my place, then you would understand. 

I have been discouraged since birth. Now I am 25.  Loser. No friends. This is not an exaggeration, I literally do not have any friends at all. I have no one to talk to( and please dont pretend to care and say ""can i talk to you?"" or ""I care"", becasue trust me, according to experience, there were only people who say that, but no action). I don't have anything to live for. I just have this huge void where my feelings used to be and all that's left is this overwhelming sense of despair and I just cannot cope any more. Either way I can't take this suffocating loneliness anymore. It hurts every single day and it's just not worth it anymore."
Earth's Ultimatum,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/earths-ultimatum.121992/,"Like many others on this forum I struggle with self-esteem, self-image, the whole lot. Yet, I never pin that to my feelings of killing myself. They come randomly sometimes in the day or when I have depressed bouts. Sometimes when I read or am learning about something on this planet or in this universe or, just think about how vast everything is, I cut myself off in thought with ""I want to kill myself."" When I think about how amazing every little detail we humans have and how perfect it is I want to die. I was hiking last year and when I got to the peak it was so beautiful, every little blade of grass and the thick white clouds with the golden sun's light tracing over their edges and falling over through the cloud's curves and cracks to make the sky look so heavenly. I was shocked that after my brain did that great tangent about how wonderful it looks was that the next immediate thought was to just jump off the edge.

     These thoughts are so casual sometimes that everyone has suicidal thoughts. I realize I have depression and I'm not fond of that and I just think every gets sad. I think this earth is so cool. How right now I'm on here with the chance of having at least one other person read this across the globe while I continue through the week and grow and age. How these something or someone made these blinds in front of me. What used to be on this Earth years before us. Suicide seems so romantic to me. And I think this and then think how pitiful and pathetic that thought is. I should live, I've worked hard and I know my future might have nice avenues. But I won't get to see all the places on my planet because i'm doubtful I'll come into a large sum of money. This is hard to type because I'm fearful of being scrutinized but I've had to stop therapy and I'm concerned for my well being, sometimes. whatever. maybe it's just an anxiety thing. I just want someone to relate to this."

Why can't I stop thinking about this?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why-cant-i-stop-thinking-about-this.122159/,"Had a sort of breakdown in class today. No one could tell and I was very discreet about how I was feeling, smiling and talking and laughing like normal, but I don't feel normal at all. I know some of my closer friends can definitely see what's going on but I don't feel comfortable enough to explain what's going on with me yet. I've only known them for a couple of years and I like and trust them but it's very hard to tell them my story. I talk more to my long distance friends about it and another close friend here who isn't in school with me.



Lately school has been giving me anxiety. I've missed the past 2 classes and today I was so mentally a wreck that I couldn't even take my quiz. I just walked out while the rest of the class was taking it and took a 0. I'm behind in almost every class and I have no motivation or concentration to care or catch up.



My apathy and lack of care is concerning me. I'm still SO suicidal. All day I keep thinking about how I don't want to be alive and that I wish I could just die. Over and over I find myself thinking, ""I wish I could just not exist anymore."" It pains me to feel so poorly about everything and unable to find joy for long periods of time. These suicidal thoughts can be so overbearing sometimes that I just want to break down and cry and usually I do. I still feel very lost."

I'm sorry that I have failed you all. My mind does not want to get better, it has decayed and broken to a point where recovery is simply impossible. My mind refuses treatment, it refuses anything short of a cure. I tried to fight it, but in the end, the depression won. Perhaps I just looked for treatment too late. My mind is so broken at this point that I'm a danger to people around me. I've considered terrible things today, things I don't want to speak about to anyone for you all would see me as a monster if I did.



I do not know if I will commit suicide or if I will simply let my mind and body decay until I just die, but one thing is for certain, there is only one cure for me, and that is to cease living.



I'm going to immediately give my rebuttals to some of the posts I will immediately get. No, a psychiatrist will not help me, nor will a hospital. I will simply toss aside the advice they give me and go on with my misery. It is how my mind is now, refusing treatment, only accepting a cure which does not exist.



I can not be happy, it is a simple impossibility. Life is not worth living. At least...Mine isn't.

BTW I can't go back on them because I'm participating in a clinical trial and I have to be clean for that (another two months) besides, I can't afford the pills, another reason I stopped taking them.

However I am medicated for this and few symptoms for the last years. No admittance to hospital. However I also have a rare neurological disorder called visual-snow. It causes me black and white spots like TV static in the visual field and disturbances in evenings when this is most notable. I can not walk at night because I can't see. I have suffered visual-snow for the last 3-4 years but progressed badly the last month because I drank some vodka with my brother and his friends and girlfriend. This caused a bad spike. I am also on government disability money. I have no friends for many years and this is causing big anxiety living alone and I have no future. I really can't cope and see no way out.

Is this melodramatic?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/is-this-melodramatic.122548/,"I have looked for help for several years now, receiving little or none. It is difficult, I don't want to sound like I am crying out for attention, but then I need the help. It's taken courage to even get to this point, I don't like talking to people about things like this. Yet I don't think I am ready to die. 



My problem I suppose is that I have many physical curses. That is what I call them, curses. Because there is no better way to describe them. I have a total of 15 medical conditions, that's just the physical stuff. I also have the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, though my psychiatrist would not diagnose this. Why? because I am 'functional'. Except he has absolutely no idea.



I don't want to be diagnosed with anything. I don't want to be labelled - but then this is the only way to get help it seems. I have fought for help, been refused and laughed at and mocked by the medical system. Just the whole system in general really. 



I am sick of fighting, I am sick of trying. 



I just want someone who understands - someone who is not so emotionally involved that every time I talk about [self-mutilation] they cry and refuse to think rationally, or offer me any form of real advice beyond 'well that will damage your health'. I am smart (well, sort of). I KNOW it will damage my health. That is why I want to do it....

"""Go to a therapist if you want to talk about it""",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/go-to-a-therapist-if-you-want-to-talk-about-it.122136/,"I'm not sure what else to do now. I've been dealing with my depression & anxiety for as long as I can remember, & the older I get, the worse it gets. Four years ago, I was doing everything to push it to the back of my mind & ignore it. I didn't form real relationships with anyone, I wanted no commitments, I drank, smoked, and began to realize that I hated the person I had become. I knew that I had to change something, so I took a trip out of state to see my mom (who I'm not really all that close to. I just needed a change of scenery.) But when I got here, I met someone. Someone who, without trying, without even realizing, brought me back to my senses, and almost made me forget all about my sadness and my anxiety. Never have I been closer to anyone, never have I had what I would call a ""real"" relationship until he came along. But, of course, depression & anxiety will never just disappear. 



a few months ago, I finally told him about the anxiety issues, because they started to get bad again. He was for the most part supportive. He didn't quite understand it (because no one who doesn't suffer from it could fully understand it.) I really try not to use it as a crutch, but the worse it got, the more I receded into my own little world. I was never really comfortable at family gatherings, because my anxiety skyrockets in social situations. So gradually I didn't go as much. I don't really keep ""friends"" because they've always been more trouble than they're worth. Then, of course, more and more, my suicidal thoughts crept back in, my depression became a constant, overwhelming presence. I know there are factors leading into this. We want different things out of life. I want a baby, a family of my own, and he's already got two daughters he adopted (both grown now and out of the house) he doesn't want to start over. I understand his side of this. 



I tried to confide in him how I felt. I want these things and don't want to give them up for good. But I also don't want to give him up. I wasn't pushing him to do anything, or to change his mind. He has no idea what he means to me, I wouldn't do that... I just needed to talk. But when I really just needed him to be there for me, to listen to me, and finally let it come out that I have depression, and that I just needed someone to care, and didn't want to feel alone anymore, he told me that if I wanted to talk, to go to a therapist. 



I poured my heart out to him, the only person I really trusted, and was rejected. He basically told me that he didn't care, he was tired of hearing it, that I needed help and meds and to leave him alone. & now, unbeknownst to him, I sit here in constant pain, just doing what I've always done. Putting on a happy face and slowly but surely wanting to die more and more. When I'm alone I do nothing but cry and have panic attacks. I've managed to keep it together at work for the most part. I went to the ER because something in me just gave way and I needed to turn somewhere. I start therapy and probably meds soon but even if this helps I feel betrayed. I love him, I know someone must be wondering why, but please understand he is a good man, and we've had four happy years together. I don't want anyone to think badly of him. 



I've thought of leaving, of course, because I want a baby and to be back home, closer to my family. Right now I'm twelve hours away from them. But the thought of leaving breaks my heart, and I know I don't want to be away from him. Leaving would mean never seeing him again. I don't know what else to do. I don't want to keep hurting but it seems inevitable no matter what I choose I'll be leaving something behind."

started building since i got up, growing on the train



almost broke down ordering a fucking breakfast from the deli

That's why i hate living. It's all about being picked up and destroyed by others. And feelings, i hate them. 

I don't want to feel a thing. I wonder how's it like to be numb from everything. 



I barely know what loneliness is. It's cold, and very unpleasant. I'd never feel that before, eventhough i'm all alone, because i was alone. It's also hurts, and i don't like it.



But then again, what choice do i have? I was alone since the beginning. I don't know about my family but i think they don't care. No one care.



i hate pain, i really do. That's why i built those 'walls', to prevent myself from getting hurt. I also create those 'worlds' where i could feel everything i want. Where i could feel love. And by my own choice, i sealed that world away from me. I was so sad at first. Those were my first time i feel so lonely in my own bedroom. Those were my first time i feel so empty. And those were my first time i feel so terrified by emptiness..          



But then again, i knew i couldn't live like that, drowning in those unreal feelings i felt whenever i imagine myself in certain situations. It's not right and i need to stop. 



That's why i tried to reach out for help. i tried to scream for help. Two hands answered it. They pulled me up, so that i won't drowned in there. Yet i'm afraid to know them further.   Afraid that i would get hurt later. I was being so careful, until they embrace me with warmth and acceptance.        



I could never ask for anything better. Everything was perfect. I got someone to understand, someone who accept me and my problems.



But it was short-lived..

Their hand, which hold mine tightly before, now letting it go. Letting myself drowning again after i sealed my source of safety away, leaving me with this cold emptiness... 



I knew it's my fault, i already said sorry and they said everything was okay. But i just couldn't shake the feelings that there's a huge wall between us now, as if they hate me, they don't need me anymore, they sick and tired of me.    



Now i don't care anymore, i just want to sleep peacefully and being numb forever. I know this is very selfish of me and i know this is silly, but for me it's not. I value friendship and relationship a lot. That's why i'm being very careful with whoever tried to get close to me."
"Double depression, marriage in shambles, not sure how much longer I'll hang on",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/double-depression-marriage-in-shambles-not-sure-how-much-longer-ill-hang-on.122105/,"As a child I was always described as a sad and angry child, quite different from my siblings as they were your standard happy children. I was born with a severe clef lip and palette which took many surgeries to mostly fix. It is now barely noticeable. Also had many ear infections which slowed my speech development. This made me socially awkward and gave me extremely low self-esteem. Suicidal ideation started at around age 13 and have only intensified. I tried to bury myself in distractions and play many different sports as well as many hours of video games, but never really had any friends. Never could connect with anyone, not even my parents or siblings. In fact, I can't remember ever felling any positive emotions such as love or joy. There are things I like doing not because they make me happy, but because they distract me from the pain, misery and suicidal thoughts for a while.



At 18 I had my first experience with a girl showing interest in me. We've now been married for 12 years and have 4 kids. About 2 years ago I finally went to a Dr. about my depression. She diagnosed me with double depression (dysthymia and MDD). My baseline mood seems to be much lower than the average person with intermittent bouts of MDD. I still can't seem enjoy anything or feel happiness. Even after 2 years of various antidepressants and CBT. The only thing I've gotten out of these are side effects that I'd rather not be dealing with. It's so bad that I couldn't even find joy at the birth of any of my 4 kids. What kind of parent does that make me? What kind of horrible person does that make me? I don't want to be a father, yet I have these 4 kids against my wishes (more on that in a bit). I resent having these kids but I don't resent the kids themselves. They are just your average kids that cause normal kid stress, they didn't ask to be born to me, none of this is their fault. So, I attempt to give them the father they deserve, but am having difficulties. I take them to the park, to their sport games and practices and out to the store when they beg to go with me, yet I hate every moment of it. When I come home from work my 2 year old drops what she's doing and runs to me yelling 'dada'. Objectively I know this should be a cute and joyful moment, yet I feel nothing. So, I put on a fake smile, pick her up, kiss her on the cheek and give her a hug.



The relationship with my wife has broken down. Shortly into our relationship she pressured me into not using condoms saying it'll feel better and that she's on birth control. Pushover me (which she admits is a trait that attracter her to me) gave in and at 3 months into our relationship she was pregnant. Under pressure from her and false societal programming I did 'the right thing' and married her at the age of 18. I also went to college to get away from crap jobs now that I had a family. During this time my wife started pressuring me for another kid. I didn't want any more kids and I surprisingly held my ground. But, she ended up pregnant again even though we always used condoms. After checking the info on the box of condoms about failure possibilities I discovered pin holes in all of the unused condoms. She ended up admitting to it and that she purposely stopped taking birth control to get pregnant with our first as well. I should have left her then, but pussy doormat me caved to her pleas for forgiveness and stayed. She said she did it because she loved me so much that she wanted a family with me. Over the next 6 years or so she ended up pressuring/guilting me into 2 more kids. By that time I was broken, I caved to stop the constant pressure and nagging.



Before getting pregnant with our 4th, I found inappropriate messages between my wife and a coworker of hers from a part time job she got to help with our crushing debt. The lies and blame she laid on me over the next few months was staggering. Again, I should have left her. They finally cut off contact and she quit the job and the both swore it never got physical. The messages did have a lot of declarations of love for each other but didn't indicate they'd been physical either. Doormat me stayed. We've had bad luck with medical bills and are heavily in debt. I didn't think I could afford a divorce. Things did get better for a time after our last child was born. But 2 year after the first 'emotional affair' I found out she was in one with another coworker front he same place. More lies, more blaming me. When I confronted him he apologized to me and said she told him we were separated and getting a divorce. He said it never got passed a few make out sessions. This is info she wouldn't even give up. He did cut contact with her and move on, so I assume he's telling the truth, plus I have no evidence to the contrary. This time I did leave. But, she begged me to come back for the kids. Seeing as we are near bankrupt, and can't even pay all of our bills, and I really didn't have any place to go as I have no friends and family is in no position to take me on. I came back.



I'm done, I want out. I don't want to be a husband or a father. I don't want to live anymore. I need this pain and darkness that I've felt for my entire life to end. I think about killing myself many times a day. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is the obligation I have to these 4 kids. Pills didn't help, CBT didn't help, my Pastor and the rest of those hypocrites didn't help , meditation didn't help. I'm trapped in this pain and misery. I have also thought about just leaving and not looking back. Again, my duty to these kids keep me from doing it. Next plan would probably be to divorce and do joint custody. Seeing as she's a stay at home mom at the moment and I work a full time job I'd give her majority custody. This would strain our already bankruptcy level of debt. Our house is in foreclosure, we do have a cheap rental lined up though. I'm afraid that if I move out, it'll be too easy for me to slowly exit the kids lives. It would probably be me slowly reducing how much time I have them until I rarely have them at all. They don't deserve an absent father. But I despise their mother. She's not a bad mother to the kids, it's just the lying, cheating and manipulation she has done to me. She controls our finances, and gets mad at me every time I've tried to take them over. Pussy doormat me always caves. I make way too much money to be this poor as a Software Engineer.



I often think my death, if I can make it look like an accident, would be best. I'd be free of this pain and misery, wife and kids would get life insurance money, and maybe they'd get a step-dad that can be emotionally present for them instead of this fucked up person they currently have.  I fear the time where the pain overrides the guilt is coming soon and I try for that 'accidental' death. ‰ÛÜ"
People are forgetting about me.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/people-are-forgetting-about-me.122280/,"I don't want to get into too much detail. But I am crying right now. Over friendships that have changed so much. People who want me out of their lives.



I see them constantly posting happy stuff on Facebook, etc. I can't hold in the pain of feeling forgotten. I post a tiny bit about how I'm feeling, and maybe a link to an article about homelessness (I'm homeless right now). I get hardly any ""likes"".""No one gives a damn.



These two people post food photos or whatever and get tons of messages. I feel so invisible. It hurts so bad.



I feel worthless, they used to like me OK. But not now. And no, I won't cut ties with them. That would hurt even worse. I'm crying as I type and trying not to be too loud since I'm crashing at the apartment of some friends.



Do you ever feel so useless to people? They just stop caring about your pain. It's like, the more I show pain the less they care."
Ignored and triggered,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/ignored-and-triggered.122575/,"I'm having suicidal thoughts right now. I made a thread on here and didn't get any responses, good thing that the thread got deleted. Than to top if off I got ignored by my family tonight and that just topped the cake. My mother talked right over me and yet again I feel like I don't matter to my family. Now I'm thinking I'm being ignored on here as well, I feel like pushing everyone away right now. I'm triggered by being ignored and now I have so many negative and angry thoughts going on through my head. I love who I am as a person and I won't change for anyone....but due to this trigger I'm very depressed, angry and thinking that dying is the way to go right now. Anytime I'm ignored by anyone, it brings back so many horrible memories of when I used to be ignored. Right now I feel like doing something destructive or hurting myself in some way, and I'm fighting with myself so much right now.... and death keeps racing through my mind."
I cant hold on tonight,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-cant-hold-on-tonight.122637/,"My birthday is tomorrow. I spent hours today laying on my 2 year olds floor sobbing while he kept bringing me toys and patting my back. I feel like such a horrible mother. But I don't know how to face the world without my husband. I wasn't ready to see his lifeless body around that corner. I wasn't ready to give the order to take him off the only medication forcing his heart to pump. I was ready to wait patiently for him to die for the final time. I wasn't ready to hold him as he left this world at 23, never to return. I wasn't ready to lay on his chest as I always did but it not move. How do I face my birthday when half of me died 2 months ago. How do I raise a child when half of me is gone. I feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way but all I want tonight is to join him.. I'm angry that my heart is still beating while his isn't. I'm angry that he's in the ground and I'm up here. My thoughts don't even make sense, I want to crawl in that coffin with him and just die. I want to be with him anyway possible."

My parents should've aborted me, thrown my fetus in the trash and set it on fire.  Life is not a blessing... it is a celestial chore.  Life is only a blessing in rare RARE cases...  I have nobody to talk to and everything I own is getting broken to the point of being unfixable... my car, my computer, my body... everything.

I just want it to end,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-just-want-it-to-end.122600/,"Every day I dread waking up because I know that I will have to fight the urge to want to kill myself all day long. It is getting to be a tiring battle that I don't want to take part in anymore. I find no joy in anything and I keep thinking it would be such a good idea to just take my own life. My bank account is dwindling down to nothing since I've been unemployed for so long and the longer I'm unemployed the harder it will be to find a job. I am trying to finish up this one last semester for school but I might not even have the money. Then after I spend all my money on that I still won't have a guaranteed job.



Everyone here is too busy for me. People are too busy working and having lives - things I don't have anymore. I am a loser who sits home and drinks and smokes weed all day because I have nothing else going for me. Where I used to live everyone has forgotten about me or doesn't have the time to talk.  My ex used to be one of the most supportive people and now he doesn't even answer a text message from me. I go out of my way to try and hang out with people where I live now and I continuosly get shut down.



I've never felt so alone before. I feel like no one gives a shit about me and I don't give a shit about myself anymore. I want something to happen to me so that I can just die already. It is too painful to wake up every day with nothing to do but try not to think suicidal thoughts. I drink and smoke so that I can calm down or at least go to sleep. Everything I am doing is worthless, just like me. I'm not even living, I'm just existing and I don't want to exist anymore. Years and years of therapy can't undo the damage that was done to me as a little girl and I don't want to even grow older. At the rate I am going, I am going to develop another substance abuse problem. I'm too crazy for this world. I just want to go."
Ignored,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/ignored.122536/,"When you're struggling being ignored could very well be the most painful thing ever, especially when you try reaching out.



I feel like I'm borderline invisible. I feel like I don't matter. I feel like I should just give up. (Mod Edit-Methods)I want to stop breathing."
I don't know,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-dont-know.122091/,"I don't know what to say, how to feel about it, or what to do. My mind won't let me, in good conscience, talk to my friends or family or girlfriend about it. 





I'm not suicidal but I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive but I have no specific plan of my own I just have the wish. I'm so ashamed of myself for not being positive enough or not doing the best I can as far as college and my part-time job go. I feel like I'm not good at anything and compliments on things I do just make me feel bitter and exhausted because I don't want to pretend I agree with people who think I do anything right. I don't do anything right, I barely just manage at everything I'm always scraping by the edge of the bare minimum for everything.



I feel like all my friends are so far ahead of me, I always see people going out and doing so much with their professional achievements and while I'm normally a calm introvert who likes going out only once a week or less I just feel so shitty for being stagnant and still being in college and not even having anything important going on. For reference, I'm supposed to be a finishing senior but I've retaken a few classes so I'm a junior in terms of credits.



I feel guilty when I think about my huge lack of success because I feel like a leech on my parents and I feel like an unspoken burden on my girlfriend of 2 years. I'm able to enjoy talking to her and spending time with her but part of me in the back of my head just tells me she's ever-so-slightly ashamed of me too and hoping in the near future that I'll start being like a normal guy and doing stuff with my life. She's a straight-A student in pre-med in an accelerated program and I like talking about her but she's the first person I've been serious with that I haven't become dependent on in some unhealthy way. Typically when I feel like shit I try not to vent it at all to her and look for alternatives because I don't want to condition her into expecting depressing stuff out of me when I message her. I try my best not to talk to anybody unless I'm unreasonably happy or I really have to ask them something. I feel extremely guilty having symbiotic friendships where the give and take is expected to be 50/50 because I hate telling people how I feel or what I'm thinking about. I feel guilty for treating people like therapists or treating them like they should have to listen to me vent because it feels whiny and I hate the feeling I get when I vent to friends. Ideally I've wanted to air out my mind to strangers but I've never known what to do specifically because not everyone really wants to hear someone's complaints.





Most answers and advice I get just feel like random phrases thrown at me, I'm confused about myself and what I'm doing and I don't want to keep going on because I feel like I can't do anything right and I feel like I'm wasting the time of everyone associated with me. I don't know how to put into words what I actually feel it's complicated but it's also really minimal it's not a deep feeling it's just hard to describe



I'm afraid of life and angry at myself for performing so low under my own standards and I don't know how to stop doing so badly at things I've been trying and trying but I procrastinate with college and at work I don't get reprimanded or anything but when I look at my own work I can't be satisfied with it I make too many little mistakes and they drive me mad. I don't like saying sappy or sad things in general either, I can't stand the idea of keeping a general because I'm so critical of saying or thinking negative/sad things it makes me cringe.



I don't know what I'm doing

I don't know what I want to do

I don't know what I should do

I just wish I would stop being here

I just want to painlessly go in my sleep I feel worn out I feel more tired mentally than anything I just feel like my emotions are beating me senseless from the inside out and I don't even know what all those emotions are because I keep them pushed down so far for so long because I'm ashamed of being sad. I feel like I don't deserve to be sad or upset because I don't rightfully have any room to complain about my life or life in general.



the best way I can put how I feel is that I'm sorry for living

I didn't choose this I don't know why I have to be the person I am I'm an idiot I didn't choose to be born as someone I'm disappointed in



I can't do this anymore I don't want to be here but I don't know what to do I feel like I'm stuck I'm just trapped here I can't go forward or leave I'm afraid I'm going to be hurting my own success and self-confidence and ruining things for myself and I don't want to deal with that I just wish I could die before I have to face how shitty and meager my life is going to be once other people are as sick of me as I am and I'm out on my ass because my overly generous parents finally wise up and cut me off I feel so guilty even though I work I shouldn't be living here I get treated too well.



I want to know if anyone can even relate to this I don't know what kind of reply I'm looking for--if any at all.



I don't need much attention though, I'm not in danger, I'm the last person to kill myself, there are so many other people who have urgent situations that could use some kind of help but I'm just here because I've wracked my brain and run out of options in my mind

I want to commit suicide but not die,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-want-to-commit-suicide-but-not-die.122087/,"This is weird.



I have my suicide planned out - I have almost everything ready down to the date and time and method.



But I can't figure out if I want to die or not? I just want to be taken seriously, I guess. It is extremely hard feeling valid when you're a teenage girl with depression. Online is so toxic - everywhere everyone seems to be going through one thing or another. If I die then people will know. They will think - she was one of the real sufferers. And they will appreciate me more when I am gone than they ever will while I'm still alive.



Even the countless counsellors, GP's, therapists. They never take you seriously until you harm yourself. I can see why but it really really upsets me.



Another thing that stops me going through with this is that I keep hoping to have some kind of 'experience'. I crave the comfort of religion but I just can't bring myself to ever believe in that. Secretly I'd just love to have a NDE.



But I don't know. Honestly I don't really care if I die or not - I just want to attempt suicide and see what fate chooses for me.

He is socially isolated since birth by everyone. He has attempted suicide many times and suffers severe depression like me. He is now in high school. He has nobody to turn to and is ignored no matter what he does( he has been to many therapists and nothing worked). Recently, he asked me if things will ever change for the better in high school?

I spend my evenings and weekends doing pretty much nothing.  Can only deal with the yard in small pieces. Asthma gets in the way.  Can't throw myself into my favorite past time, stuffing my face.  Causes too much pain in digestive tract.  Highlight of my days are a shower and going to bed.  I had hoped to be dead long ago.  But life just doesn't work out like you want it to.  I am chicken to off myself.  Its been pounded into my head that is the wrong thing to do.  Sometimes I wish life would get a little bit worse.  Just bad enough to push me over the edge.

Long list of what u might consider life sucess,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/long-list-of-what-u-might-consider-life-sucess.122647/,"Recently I am always having trouble with self harm. I am not much to ask any one for help.

I am always smiling and happy. Perhaps to happy.

I cant hold down a job I am my 106 new job starting Monday.

I cant hold or hug people.

I dress up in fursuits to look like a dog.

And I have no education or goals.

I have no friends in school or life.

I build amazing things requiring a university education.

I realize I am not like any one else. Each day for me is difficult because when I try to get help I feel like people are paid to help me or studying me.



My background is I had no father, Raped from age 4 till I was 11

and my mom was into prostitution. My brother were taken away by child welfare and Both are in prison.

I don't have any family.



I tried hard to understand what is wrong with me and why no one likes me.

Recently I did several real prison tests based on Psychopath Testing. I score 98%

I am a bit concerned because I cant be intimate with any one but a part of me love everyone.

I don't know if I am straight, gay or neither.

My moods are up and down.

Each day I think about how the world is better without me.

I wish I could find a person similar to relate to because getting help is very hard to do."
