New thread! Let's get rid of the word meditation and it's concepts,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=97470,"So, how does that sound...?



I have been reading around in different threads and there seems to be a

a recurring 'issue'.

Hard to stop thoughts

Distracted

Lack of success, whatever.



NOW, what if you tossed that entire word and at the beginning... you 'sat'.

That's all...comfortably sat, still, quietly for a certain amount of time?

And them, threw out all concepts of mindlessness, mindfulness, emptiness and samadhi?



So let's say for a month you sat in the darkness and stillness of being undisturbed...to enjoy thought.



Thought about wondrous things...thinking 'a movie scene' for 30 minutes.



About....love...$$...travel...a new baby...happiness in everything...confidence and freedom....



What does that mean? You have enjoyed yourself, changed your chemistry, 

relaxed every system in your body...and MADE A NEW GROOVE in your brain...of Joy!



One month...then let's talk about this 'emptying'...and a

 successful meditation...hahahha!"
Entering into the Sacred Space within the Heart,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=93427,"I am wondering, if anyone is familiar with this meditation by Drunvalo Melcizhedek. Whether you know him or not is not really important, though I am also interested is what those that know him, think of him. I did follow him, and read some of his books some time ago, and the written material felt o.k. I also watched some of his live shows which were good, but after some time, I felt something bugging me with him. It was hard to explain you know, just the feeling, which for the most part is good to listen too.



Anyways this thread is mostly about the meditation, and if someone got any experience with it? I read this meditation when I was about 16 years old and also tried it back then with no success. I tried various times but not enough to really succeed. 



You can find meditation on youtube if you search with the name of the thread.



To sum it up quickly, there is a certain space within everyone's heart, that is not a heart chakra. This space is I believe created by the hearts magnetic field, and is completely personal to your own being. When you enter it, you literally leave this world and you are consciously in that space. When you first enter it, you should find your self in some enclosed place, which is in a way your own creation and contains information about your true self. After going into that place many times, a way will present itself to leave it, and you can then enter the whole world outside which is also your own creation. Drunvalo always said, that there is an entire universe inside that space, and that the stars are the same as in real universe. In order to achieve that there are 3 basic steps;



-connecting with mother Earth and feeling absolute love-

-moving your point of consciousness to the heart

-entering the sacred space via two separate methods.



So, anyone that experienced it, please share your experiences and thoughts =) Thanks!"

"Seeing ""pin pricks"" of light",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=97230,"I've started practicing meditation while I'm laying down in bed before sleeping and I've been seeing ""pin pricks"" of light. It's almost like being in space and seeing the stars except the lights are not as bright. When I see these lights some of them move, zipping around, etc. Some lights are erratic while others move slower. I feel this sensation these things have life essence, or something, but the logical part of my mind wants to dismiss it as hallucination. When I go deeper into meditation I begin to see more and more of these lights, then the experience overwhelms me and I snap out of it. If I try to force the experience I can't see these lights, it's only when I'm relaxed and let the logical part of my mind surrender to the spirit.

What I've learned by meditating daily,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=99470,"What I have found after so many years of mediation is that the fear is gone. I can really say that the fears that I used to have are all gone. Being an empathic I never knew why I was feeling bad of sad or whatever and by meditating I know my energy and what is from someone else. Mediation has led me to think about everything and I have changed everything in my life. From thinking about food choices to Yoga practice and everything in between. I can tell you that when my heart chakra opened is the moment that the meditations went to a whole new level. I raised my vibration high enough to be able to have contact with my guide. What I have also found is that when I read something that is from someone writing from there heart I feel it. When someone is telling the truth I feel it. When I read something or hear someone talking from there head it doesnâ€™t feel right and I let it go for what it is an opinion. This is also a way that spirit talks to us.

My advice to anyone trying to raise their vibration in the meditation is to try thinking of something or someone that they really Love and with that â€œLove feelingâ€ù start to float up and just keep floating and try to stay in that feeling during the meditation. Itâ€™s the real deal.

Thatâ€™s where that magic happens. has anyone else experienced this?

Happy meditations

Meditation and science,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=88217,"Hi all, 

    As an old ""hippy"", it's been a lifelong search for me to become more enlightened. There are many well intentioned methods, and a few questionable ones, but very few places to verify their efficacy. Was taught as kid that only results you achieve via hard work and struggle, should mean anything.

    Please don't get me wrong, I've never shied away from hard work to achieve my goals, but if a method shows up that will get great results and does not require 20 years of effort, count me in. 

    So my question is: How can a conversation about the ability of frequencies being applied to our brains that result in a 20 year shortcut to improved spiritual awakenings be started? WITHOUT offending someone who has put in a lifetime of hard work, but could also result in the acceptance of scientific methods? 

     The comparison between 2 people driving down a highway with 1 using cruise control and a GPS device versus the use of the constant application of pressure to the gas pedal while fumbling with a map seems to fit. Both will get to their destination, but who will be ready sooner to move further ahead?

     This site is the only place I have found where this conversation could happen with a greater chance for science and spirituality to move closer together for a beneficial result.

Advice much appreciated,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=59586,I posted about some evp but I think in the wrong thread I'm new so hi! To cut a long story short I caught evp in a haunted building. All very clear and all taking to me. Even used my full name ! One wanted me to call the house home and stay and help. Others said that I was the active one and the key to them.the voice that said this sounded like she was a teacher she was clear and kept repeating as if she knew the message needed to get to me When I discovered only a week later that a lady I worked with was able to hear spirits she told me to use light and love and speak out whist meditating. I've never meditated before but when I had a quiet moment I relaxed and tried it out. I was amazed how fast my eyes became fluttery and I started to image things. I was I a garden and saw a large puma like cat that looked fierce but as it approached it changed and It sat beside me. Then I asked out if I had a guide. I felt my finger prickly like it had been touched then I pressed record on my phone. Anyway I discovered I had two answers one was whispered and in real time. The other was one audible when slowed down and sounded like the teacher woman from the evp. Have I met my guide? After this I got several things that scared me. One was my laptop recorded a message by itself and my tv had a whispered voice on it. Both were not really scary but I think it freaked me out because I wasn't expecting it. I asked it to stop and it did. But now I feel like this is something pretty special as I've never done this before and it's like I've opened up to something with an ease I've not known of. Should I continue to work on this? Do you think it's meant that they want me to do this? They haven't even tried to hide that they contacted me via my tele. It was infront of my previously sceptic partner! I want to learn about chakras and try meditating again but as I'm new to it I'm a bit fearful of what I'm getting into. All I know is that I'm a real lover of nature and life anyway so it kind of feels it's meant. Could I be getting into trouble or is this something I should allow to happen.

Meditation And How To Stop Your Thoughts.,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100699,"Now, it is suggested that words, analyzation and thought activity relates to the left side of the brain.  That if you have difficulty in stopping your thoughts, you can simply meditate, watching your breath go in and out and listening to the breath as it goes in and out, and in this manner you may stop the thought.



That as long as youâ€™re focused on a sound, such as the sound of your breath moving in and out, thought does not particularly enter the mind or does not need to enter the mind. And that if you are having trouble contacting the right brain, simply start watching your breath, listening to the breath, and stop thinking words, and the right brain will begin to function at that time.



Practicing this on a daily basis through meditation ( which means total and complete focus) and then through continued meditation, even as you move around your home or do things, so that words are not going through the left brain, this can help you to experience more right brain activity, even in your mundane activities.



One must understand that the right brain does not think words or thoughts as does the left brain, so that you do not receive thoughts out of the right brain and therefore, you may think that it is not working when in fact it may be working quite well in the silence that it emits.

"Lessons from Spirit, Meditation experiences, teaching, lessons, & Messages",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=99973,"Hi,



 I've had many intense teachings from Spirit while in meditation and I wanted to have a place to share some of these experiences.  In my other posts I've talked about how I meditate and my story but here I just want to share some of the things that have come up.  Please share your experiences as well! 



One of my most  intense meditations was all about energy.   It was incredible!  The words that I'm using to explain this are no match to what actually happened. But I will attemptâ€_  



I was laying down in this meditation with my eyes closed breathing in and out from my lower Dantian.  Next thing I knew,  I could see all these different yin/yang symbols floating around my body.  My eyes were still closed but I was seeing everything using my third eye.   Each of these yin/yang  symbols represented (I'm guessing) an acupuncture point.  Each symbol was  spinning. Some symbols were spinning fast and some spinning slow.   Spirit was trying tell me which parts of my body were in balance in which parts were not aligned properly.  These symbols represented  chi energy all over my body.  After that, I started looking more outside of myself and noticed  Yin/Yang  symbols in the air and all over my room. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.  It made me realize that I am living in a field of source energy. My energy is affected by other energy around me and I can affect others energy as well.  There was much more to this message but it's just so hard to explain. Some symbols were bigger than others, some symbols were rocking out of balance, some symbols were smoothly spinning,  I could balance symbols when I put my attention to it, It was like a whole other world. It also allowed me to realize our oneness. 



Please let me know if any of this makes sense to anyone and or if anyone has had this happen to them before.  I wish I could explain it more clearly but it could be something you just have to experience to understand. Let me know your feedback. Thanks!"

Not really sure what to do...,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=58976,"Hi all  



I am new to this forum and the main reason I joined was because I have a question that I cannot seem to find the answer to. 



For a little background, I am somewhat new to the idea of spirituality. I have only been meditating/opening my chakras for about two months now. One of my goals is to meet my spirit guides, but I haven't been able to achieve this yet. 



Anyways, I am physically blind in my right eye and I recently noticed that when I meditate and visualize anything, I only visualize it on the left side of my body (so basically only using my left brain). I decided to try and see if I can visualize it on my right side, and with a lot of conscious effort I can manage to move the image to the right and eventually center it the way I imagine everyone else sees the world. It can be difficult to hold the concentration though.



I noticed that when I do this, the energy feels different. It seems to flow better, but i'm not sure if i'm making it up. My question is, should centering my visions make a difference when meditating? Is it O.K. to only visualize things using the left hemisphere of the brain?



Thanks for taking the time to read such a long first post!"
Effect of meditation ?,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100128,"I have been learning meditation and started years ago, only meditating for 5 minutes and gradually building my way up. Anyway after a long break due to work i was introduced to transcendental meditation which is basically what i have been doing only with a mantra and at regular times.



I now meditated 2 times a day for 20 minutes each. Sometimes i feel really relaxed and great but most of the night meditations before bed are different.

I mediation in the seiza position (as opposed to lotus) and i get really relaxed, but last night was really intense. I often get this dizzy feeling like im about to fall over, i ignore it and continue but as i get deeper I feel fear and paranoia and have thoughts/feelings that someone or thing is going to steal my body. I feel silly saying it but that the sensation i get. When it happened last night I opened my eyes but the sensation was still there. I tried to continue through it to see what happens (i consider myself mentally strong) but then my gong sound went off and it was time to adjust to reality.



I dont usually feel fear in day t day life. I guess the only fear i have is the fear of the unknown as i dont know where this leads me.. I read into this and the symptoms I had were very similar to lucid dreaming or Out of body experiences. Only without the strong vibrations. I have had lucid dreams in the past and i can correlate. Although, i never had the fear in lucid dreaming, just excitement that prevented me having long vivid dreams.



Are these sensations normal for all those practicing meditation? Where does it lead? 



To add, i have been on ""spirit journeys"" with shamens in the Amazon and had local ""medicines"" to induce a journey but it actually never affected me. The Shaman said it doesn't affect only a handful of people and it is because my mind is too strong. I later deduced it is because I am strongly logical and and engineer and therefore very fixed to the physical realm.



Does anyone have any advice, tips, tricks, explanations or similar experiences?

Meditation - How to stop trying too hard?,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=97413,"I have been practicing meditation for over ten years with a lot of problems and, it feels like not a lot of progress has been made. 



I feel a lot of my problems stem from the fact that I try too hard when I sit. I cannot help it. The very moment I attempt to meditate some tiny cognitive command seems to subconsciously kick in and I tense up. 



Instead of observing my breath or the object in question I put a whole lot of energy into the observation process itself - in my efforts to try and get as much out of it as I can.   Sometimes its so bad I come away feeling really unstable, but I can't seem to stop it. 



I've tried various forms of meditation with the same outcome. 



If I try and relax it just gets worse...because my brain seizes on another opportunity to 'try' and the opposite ends up happening. 



A lot of really bad stuff has happened to me over the years and I just can't let go in any circumstance. I'm constantly on guard, and constantly trying / struggling to improve my life. 



The sad irony is, when I found out the peace of mind that could be attained with meditation, because being human I naturally desired this a lot, my mind could not seem to help but go into overtime and ever since has tried way too hard every time I sit. 



Please, what can I do?"

If I'm concentrating solely on my breath, I find myself forcing my breath, actively trying to breathe, and this then causes tension in my body.

I am in seek of advice considering I am a seeker I am now going to continue with my seeking experience and ask you guys a question.



I believe myself to be sensitive and empathic to the energies around me. 



I can feel anxiety...stress....positive vibes. I have also become able to visually see now also.



The thing I really wanted to ask you guys, was that I have become aware of some things that I am not certain of. For example, I will be in a observational space, and I will observe a thought. If i doubt the though, and anxiety comes, I see an orb rise from the air. As soon as I become aware of the orb it glistens like sparks a certain color..usually redish/pinkish. and it shows me its eyes and it floats away. If I am fully aware of the moment, the moment changes in its perception, it visually gets enhanced...brighter...sharper...vivid. But as soon as doubt comes back into my mind the orb comes back. Now the thing is, if I fully observe the orb and surrender my awareness to it, It turns to wicked colors like purple, green, pink, and I usually feel slightly blissfull. When I am scared of it, it turns into what looks like an aliens head and the color turns a slightly dark shade of blue. I can feel it in my body. feels like a lump of static. When I am around other people, It will sometimes attach itself to the person, and the person reports that they are in a ""spacious"" space where sometimes they will caugh and get headaches and sometimes they can feel very positive by its influence. Many People have told me that I have a strong spiritual presence and they can feel my aura. Some people get clausterphobic around me. And my crown chakra is opened ( I was attuned to reiki I and II) so i can feel there emotions and thoughts, usually feels like my mind slips away from focus and I get so lost in whats happening in the moment/mind that I cant focus on myself or the reality. Other times...Ive been told that for some reason people feel amazingly happy around me. What Ive been advised to do, was to observe this and focus on the superficial light of it, the more I am aware of it, the more I feel my body get's stronger by its presence or challenges it gives me. Ive used my third eye to see it, and what appeared to be a higher or different dimension version of my self with a duality spectrum...a ""lighter"" higher self and a presently negative ""lower"" self . Seen different symbols appear. Anyone seen a Z symbol the way it looks from dragon Ball Z? What symbol could that be? 

The energy usually is always triggered by another person or naturally by one of my own thoughts. I wish I knew how to completely transmute the negative anxiety It currently holds on to to true bliss. I am willing to converse on this topic with any positive and wiseful soul. Thanks for listening :}"

My experience with kundalini,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=99481,"I would like to share my experience with kundalini here. 



Some years ago I was meditating on a regular basis/every day. One day something moved inside me and I felt it at the bottom of my spine going all up to my head. My spine was erected. I felt how it went up and down several times. I didn't know anything about kundalini or yoga back then. So I was pretty scared at first and thought that maybe I am dying. I went on the internet to check what was going on with me. I couldn't find anything and I was mainly looking for information in medical/biology area. I didn't find what I was looking for and l continued with my meditation which was always the same. The moment when I sat down this energy which felt like strong vibrations at the bottom of my spine went up my head and down and up. It didn't come through. Sometimes I literally felt how it stuck in the middle of my head and then went back down and then again up and down. At the beginning it was quite exciting but I became frustrated over a certain period of time because it didn't move anywhere. Just up and down and it was frustrating because I couldn't sleep some times and after some time spontaneous movements occurred. I didn't know anything about yoga but I saw yogis on pictures in the past somewhere and I just knew that this is similar to yoga movements. And I also felt that this is how yoga started. That yoga probably comes from meditation and from those movements that people had while meditating. This is how I began with yoga and took a class later. I thought it will help me with this energy and I didn't do much physical activity at that time anyway. Sometimes I laid down in my bed at night and I couldn't sleep because the vibrating at the bottom of my spine was so strong. 



Not so long after that I was reading a book in which a woman travelled around the world and she also visited an ashram. She described her experience she had during meditation and her teacher told her that this is kundalini. Her experience was very similar to mine. I went on-line and read about it and saw that there are a lot of mixed information about that topic, confusing but different texts about it did have some joint points - like similar symptoms. 



But the information didn't really help in practical terms. I was stuck with this energy which moved strangely in my body and didn't progress (I felt stuck) so I stopped with meditation for some time. Later I found a new meditation on-line which stated that you should only focus on breathing and don't mind what is happening inside your body and let the energy do it's work. Before that I was always following this energy and paying total attention to it. I believe now that I was effecting the energy with my attention. So I started with meditation focusing only on my breathing and almost ignoring what is going on in my body. What happened then was that the energy started to move and circuit again. I don't feel strong vibrations at the bottom of the spine any more. This energy went up in different parts of my body which happened gradually. 



After some time my solar plexus exploded with warmth and for some time I was feeling it all the time. Later this warmth went into other parts of my body. Now I mainly feel this warmth in the area of my chest. I also feel more cold energy at the top of my head. Sometimes I felt it on the right side, sometimes on the left, sometimes at the back of my head, sometimes on my forehead, but now I mainly feel it on the top. And it also became constant. Before I could feel it only during meditation, now I feel it almost all the time. And I feel that energy is progressing all the time with every meditation I have.



My meditations are never static any more. My body moves in spontaneous ways and I can feel how the energy travels with that movements and I can hear my bones cracking. I think my body is aligning. I really enjoy doing meditation now. I love the sensations and everything that I feel. I just love it and I am eager to know what will come next. Now it's always new and fresh, new sensations and the progress is a lot faster. It's exciting. 



What are your experiences with this energy/kundalini?"

<Chester> Hi guys

<Chester> I was watching a video by Yuttadhammo Bhikku on youtube and he said porn addiction is not a problem at all.  What was he talking about?

<Chester> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Lg9P-VekA

<Bureaucat> wha

<Bureaucat> umm

<Bureaucat> I don't know...?

<Chester> He also said, he wouldn't mind, if he got cancer because he wanted to know what it felt like and that he would find it interesting.  Is he being serious?

<Bureaucat> I don't even know who that is mind you

<Chester> Bureaucat, just click on the link above

<Bureaucat> I wouldn't want to have cancer, I've seen people going through it... it's the same line of thinking of touching a hot stove to see what it feels like

<Chester> But what he said must make sense somehow?

<Bureaucat> ohh

<Bureaucat> well mind you tihs channel has nothing to do with buddhism

<Bureaucat> though I think some of us may be buddhists

<Bureaucat> it's related to the old amiga error Chester

<Chester> amiga error?  

<Bureaucat> yes

<Chester> Bureaucat, never heard of that

<Bureaucat> Chester https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation

<Bureaucat> but now I""m watching. curious.

<Chester> k

<Bureaucat> this is interesting though, thank you for linking me

<Chester> k

<Chester> No problem

<Bureaucat> I'm not sure what to think of it.

<Bureaucat> I want to agree on some level but I feel he misses out on the physical aspect of addiction

<Bureaucat> the brain's desire for these things, beyond a conscious level

<Chester> I mean how can an addiction not be a problem? Of course it is a problem

<Bureaucat> addiction is a sort of perverting the brain's reward system... it can't always be corrected by reevaluation... but... for psychological addiction yes, much of the problem is evaluating why you desire these things.

<Bureaucat> (that's physical addiction that is)

<Bureaucat> (for the reward system part)

<Bureaucat> but yes, it is an actual problem in many cases due to the physical harm it causes and the ostracising and total consumption of your life

<Chester> k

<Bureaucat> anywho

<phadthai> I guess it depends on what he needs by addiction, some people think that normal sex drive is obsessive perversion, on the other hand, for some people that drive, or their behaviours towards it seems to become a problem... if addiction there pertains to the latter, my impression is that ignoring the problem won't help to solve it

<Chester> k

<Bureaucat> special k?

<Bureaucat> :p

<phadthai> spiritual gurus are also not qualified for medical advice

<Chester> k= OK Bureaucat 

<Bureaucat> I know :P

<Bureaucat> I was being a smartass

<Chester> lol

<Chester> I get it lol

<Bureaucat> well I mean we're on the topic of addictions...

<Bureaucat> :P

<Bureaucat> I knew someone once addicted to ketamine

<Chester> Are you guys using Hex Chat Irc client?

<Bureaucat> I ma

<Bureaucat> am

<Chester> k

<Chester> cool

<Bureaucat> I think most of us use irssi or weechat

<Chester> Are those any good?

<Bureaucat> eh, they function

<Bureaucat> if you like terminals

<phadthai> good enough for irc

<phadthai> heh

<Chester> k

<Bureaucat> weechat and irssi are terminal IRC clients

<Bureaucat> but yeah phadthai is right, a lot of pastors too often give advice on addictions and I believe that much of it is misguided

<Bureaucat> often 12 step programs result in high relapse rates because you're around other addicts

<Bureaucat> as my mother would say, ""it's a great place to get drug hookups""

<Bureaucat> (she used to be addicted to drugs many years ago, not for considerable time)

<phadthai> and some claim to have ""cures"" for masturbation or homosexuality, which might not be disorders

<Bureaucat> also the AA/NA programs advocate finding god as part of the program... I don't think religion is necessarily beneficial nor necessarily required

<Bureaucat> especially if there is values dissonance between you and the church

<phadthai> others claim that ejaculation is very harmful (yet very natural), or teach sexual techniques which might actually be harmful

<Bureaucat> yeah they do

<Bureaucat> in the US we have camps to try to remove homosexuality from children... I have serious doubts about their efficacy

<Bureaucat> namely I doubt they work and I think they're frankly child abuse

<Chester> I think the DaLai Lama has accepted homosexuality now?  I am not sure, if I have read correct?

<phadthai> I believe you're right

<Bureaucat> yeah I believe so

<phadthai> I have to leave in a few minutes so will be back later

<Bureaucat> I don't see the point in religiously prohibited behaviours except those which are harmful to oneself or others

<phadthai> but before I leave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bntfUA6TmLs :)

<Bureaucat> though myself, I'm an atheist (though respect many buddhist ideas)

<phadthai> Bureaucat: well it ""makes the devil laugh""

<phadthai> haha

<phadthai> bbl

<Bureaucat> :P

<Bureaucat> there was a buddhist philosopher I found recently, I forgot his name, that I admired

<Bureaucat> Alan Watts

<Bureaucat> he's interesting

<Chester> I will look it up

<Bureaucat> he was a philosopher in the 70's but nonetheless much of his stuff has aged well

<Chester> Why is this channel called Guru meditation?

* Chester curious

<Chester> I am a Sikh and we have ten gurus

<Chester> Guru means spiritual teacher

<Bureaucat> nothing to do with that

<Bureaucat> except in the loosest sense

<Bureaucat> Chester, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation

<Chester> lol

<Chester> sorry, I thought you were a meditation channel  lol

<Chester> lol

<Bureaucat> nah

<Bureaucat> we're not religious

<Chester> lol

<Bureaucat> I mean like I said some of us have some pretty deep thoughts on the stuff

<Chester> k

<Bureaucat> perhaps it would be better if I put it in the topic :)

<Chester> yes

<Chester> lol

<Bureaucat> Chester, if you wanna stick around you're welcome to stay but you can go if you want, I mean we talk about a lot of things in here so

<Chester> k

<Chester> This is going to be the funniest story in the world lol

<Chester> No offence

<Chester> Thanks guys

World Peace And Healing Meditation,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=97966,"You are all invited to join in a Worldwide Peace And Healing Meditation to heal the problems of the world and to bring peace to humanity and the planet.



The meditation is held at 1.00 pm your own local time (wherever in the world you are), every week from Saturday 27th February 2016, lasting 25 minutes.



The meditation is to focus on specific problems in the world and to try to change mens hearts to bring a healing to them. We should concentrate on a problem that we are impressed to focus on and we should all send unconditional love to the perpetrators of the problem and the world leaders, trying to help the angels turn them away from their greed, lust, power seeking oppression and violence, and turn their hearts instead towards love, peace harmony and the nurture of God's creation, instead of the destruction. That is the only way forward.



The meditation, because of the time difference spreads over 24 hours of focussed Divine Love, Light and Healing Energies and the angels and spirit workers gather the energies that are sent out and focus them on the important areas. A focussed energy on specific areas and in this way we help the angels, with our love, to do their work. A bit like a searchlight in an evening sky.

I used brainev for a while and Lifeflow meditation for a while. Then one of my friends suggested me to do meditation without any external aid! So I started doing regular meditation. 

I do some pranayama prior to my meditation. And while meditating, I try to focus on ""Nothingness"" whilst having a mild awareness. It is not that I try to focus on nothing but rather I fix my focus on Nothingness. As if it is an object of focus. That is why it is so difficult for me to explain! I wish to know what type of meditation it is, and which category it falls under (So that I can google if I want to know more). I never try to suppress my thoughts, but when I observe that a thought is going at the back of my mind, I will bring all my focus on ""Nothingness"" and that focus won't allow me to observe that thought further. 

Right now the key elements I am developing while meditating is focus, awareness and stability of mind. And using these elements, I am getting deeper into the nothingness. I just wanted to know Your View on this. Am I doing it right? And what will be the next step of this practice? (in terms of experience and practice)

Hidden secret of wisdom try - bodhi mala in chant meditation,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=98460,"Tired of getting wisdom even you practice meditation one or two hours daily?

Beside this here are two hidden secrets for wisdom from meditation practice

If you find spirit who holds real divinity power and has ability to control and manage divinity power then that spirit can transmit spirit energy in your life for getting wisdom. And its true you wont find this kind of spiritual person.

If you are still not succeeded from the above two option then now you have only the last option available which comes in third step. You can find original and real quality meditation bodhi mala or bodhi mala which you can use to succeed in your meditation practice by doing chanting meditation with some meditation mantras along with bodhimala.

Reading Room Meditation Guidelines/Suggestions,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=98329,"Hello everyone,



Amarenlux and I will be hosting meditation sessions in Chat (in the Reading Room) every other week or so. The upcoming schedules will be posted in another thread. We hope you can join us. It is a pretty relaxed, uplifting, and healing affair. We only have a few guidelines and suggestions.



When the session begins, we try to keep talking to a minimum so that we don't distract other participants. If you have any questions or concerns, you can private message us inside the chat.



You are welcome to practice any form of meditation you are familiar with (i.e. za zen, guided, chanting, binaural sounds, whatever therapeutic and healing tracks you wish to listen to, etc. etc.). The goal is for us to raise the energy together so we can amplify and heal together. You may also wish to set intentions such as world peace, inner peace, or any personal healing intentions.



In group meditations, sometimes the energy can amplify very quickly and this may cause a bit of a sensory overload if you are unfamiliar with meditation. You may then become a bit over charged with energy. If this occurs, you can do several things. Exit the session, drink some water, ground and center yourself (ie. channel the energy into the ground), take a shower, etc. Basically anything you can think of to calm and dissipate the excess energy.



Lastly, some of us while in meditation would like to connect to the Universe or Source. A simple way to do that is visualize a column of white Divine Light descending into your body and your body being healed and illuminated by pure healing Love and Light. I am sure those familiar with meditation will have varying methods and you are welcome to do whatever is most comfortable for you.



Thank you! I hope you can join us and keep an eye out for upcoming scheduled sessions posted in another thread.

My take so far is although it relaxes my body, and I can get my mind into a neutral state easier and tune out more outside distractions. I feel I'm missing out on the full experience due to the numbness, and I also seem to lose some memory of when I was in my meditative state.

How do you know if you are doing the meditation correctly?,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100415,"First you must know "" What is MEDITATION? "" before you start meditating.



Meditation is journey from sound to silence, from movement to stillness.

People have different concepts about meditation. According to many, meditation is concentrating on something. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says, meditation is deconcentration. Meditation is accepting this moment â€“ living every moment totally. However, the result of meditation is improved concentration.



When the mind is engaged in some activity, it gets tired. So any type of concentration, contemplation or any activity in the mind can drain your system. Meditation is that which doesn't drain you, but just gives you deep rest. It is almost like sleep, but not exactly sleep. Meditation calms the mind and gives it deep rest



How to Meditate?

1.	There is no need to get into any particular posture, unless you feel like it. Just keep your spine straight. While meditating if spine bend , don't think that you were doing wrong, it may happen. Whenever you become aware that your spine is bent , again straighten your spine.



2.	Do not position your attention in any particular way.



3.	Let whatever happens happen. Let the random thoughts come. You can't control thoughts. Remember whatever you resist, it persists.



4.	Any time you notice yourself doing anything intentionally, stop. Doing anything intentionally means something you can voluntarily control, and therefore can stop. If you cannot stop doing something, then it's not intentional, and therefore you don't need to try to stop doing it. So, Anything you can stop doing, stop doing.



        Some examples of things you can stop doing are:                                           

         (a) Intentionally thinking     

         (b) Trying to have equanimity          

         (c) Trying to keep track of what's going on          

         (d) Trying to focus on something specific            

         (e) Trying to meditate     

         (f )Let go of doing anything like this

    

5. Keep doing nothing for at least 10 minutes, or as long as you like.

It's not as easy as it seems , but practice will make you perfect.

Everytime you meditate your experience will be different. There is nothing like RIGHT or WRONG in meditation.



Whenever you feel SLEEPY or taking a NAP after meditation , you were not meditating (You were SLEEPING). If you feel +ve energy, deep rest, calm mind, fresh, enthusiastic etc after meditation you were meditating."

"Vibrating, Spinning, Feeling a pull, Chills, Chakras and other stuff in meditation",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=92422,"Hello everyone. I came here hoping to find answers to some doubts I have at the moment.



So, I started meditating (or trying to) some months ago. The first few times I couldn't do it for long because I would get distracted by sounds like cars or dogs barking. 



I solved that by listening to music while I meditate. So after that I was able to meditate for about 40 minutes.



Everything was going well, at least from a beginnerâ€™s point of view (whom has no experience in these things whatsoever) until I suddenly started to feel like I was vibrating. My body was vibrating. I got really scared and stopped immediately.



That made me put meditation on hold for a few months and now I've started again.



So, after a few minutes I feel like I have something in my throat chakra. It's like I can't breathe, like I'm going to choke. Then, this feeling goes down to my heart chakra and once again I feel that I can't breathe. It feels like burning. Then, finally it goes down to my navel and it feels like I have butterflies (you know, like when you're in love).



After this, all I see is a black smoke with rays of light (like a dark sky with lightning) and I feel that I'm going to be eaten by it. Suddenly I'm spinning. I'm not sure if I'm spinning to the right or to the left. It feels like I'm spinning both ways. I try to not be afraid and embrace it so the spinning keeps happening for a while longer. I notice that I breathe less and less but I feel fine.



But after a while I get scared again because I feel my eyes like burning and they start blinking (even though they are closed) and I feel a pull, like I'm being pulled towards the ceiling. So I stop.



After I stop, it takes me a while to actually ""come back"" (for lack a better way to explain the feeling). You know, it's like I'm here but I'm not really here yet. I open my eyes but it doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m awake. And I'm so dizzy that I feel like I'm going to faint. And I get chills. I donâ€™t feel cold but I get tons of chills.



Is all this normal? Is it supposed to happen, at least to a beginner? 



Thank you to everyone in advance."

Meditation is confusing and stressful,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100528,"I'm sorry, this is probably a repeat question/issue.



I simply don't understand even the most basic instructions for meditation. I've tried to do it anyway - the longest was about 2 months of daily attempts. I read about people being relaxed, but I more often wound up sad or violently angry without reason, and my base stress level increased throughout the day. And I'm so confused that I'm hesitant to start again... but the truth is that I'm trying to do occult practices, which often tell me to enter a trance or meditative state and it seems the only way to figure out what the instructions tell me is to meditate.



I've tried reading, and find things like ""returning to object"" or descriptions of proper concentration/relaxation confusing. I'm not sure I know the difference between comfortable and relaxed - the more I think about relaxing, the more confusing the concept is. Most of mine have been single-pointed concentration - breath, gravity, drumming. I have no clue what I'm supposed to be paying attention to with breath, and if I get stressed it changes the breathing and compounds it all. I was once told to pay attention to all of it, and I'm left wondering how to focus on the nose hairs moving while still being focused on the diaphramn feelings. Gravity I wound up just thinking about it - to the point of the cells consistently fighting off gravity. It was rather uncomfortable. 



I've read things that tell me that I'm not supposed to form thoughts about the object I'm concentrating on, nor am I supposed to use my ""inner narrator"". I read about the mind being ""still"" and being ""completely relaxed"" And the truth is that I have no clue how to even attempt this stuff, let alone know if whatever I attempted to do was correct. 



It is like I'm so far into confusion that no part of this makes sense anymore, and I can't find anything I can grasp.

The vision started with a bed with a white cover with a blue tint to it. The walls were a bluish-grey color and the carpet was grey. This guy (that I've constantly dreamed and had visions of before) was sitting on the bed in a meditative position. He was moving around like he was getting relaxed for his meditation. What do you think this could mean?



Back in November, I had asked the Universe (I'm big on manifestation) for something to save my life since I'm severely depressed and anxious. That night I had my first dream of him and we were in the Universe. Just us.



I've had a few visions of him other than the one of him meditating.



Usually when I dream of people, I meet them later on. It's happened with like five people now, so that's why I'm so sure about this guy.



I've been so happy ever since I've been having these visions of him. And I just feel he's already here. Like I can just walk up the street and hang out with him.



Also along with what that vision meant, what can I do to speed this up? I'm currently listening to subliminal message videos.

The meditation is held at 1.00 pm your own local time (wherever in the world you are), every week starting from Saturday 9th January 2016, lasting 25 minutes.



The meditation is to focus on specific problems in the world and to try to change mens hearts to bring a healing to them. We should concentrate on a problem that we are impressed to focus on and we should all send unconditional love to the perpetrators of the problem and the world leaders, trying to help the angels turn them away from their greed, lust, power seeking oppression and violence, and turn their hearts instead towards love, peace harmony and the nurture of God's creation, instead of the destruction. That is the only way forward.



The meditation, because of the time difference spreads over 24 hours of focussed Divine Love, Light and Healing Energies and the angels and spirit workers gather the energies that are sent out and focus them on the important areas. A focussed energy on specific areas and in this way we help the angels, with our love, to do their work. A bit like a searchlight in an evening sky.

Dream like images.,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=13618,"I have practiced meditation before for a brief period, but I have recently started doing it more seriously. I usually only have time for about twenty minutes at a time. 

The last time I did though, I had a few strange images and I was wondering if any of these things sounded meaningful to anyone.

 

It was as if I was in a dream. I was laying down in a dark room and there were other, older people there. An old man, who was also laying down, was talking to me in a stern tone. As he layed back down from this, a neon blue outline of his entire body started leaving his body. It was like an aura but with more form. Then I looked to the left and saw a lady doing the same thing, except she was standing. Then my 'vision' went somewhere else and I saw hundreds of these neon colored outlines floating along a black, purple, and blue back ground that looked sort of foggy. Some of the outlines of these people were yellow and orange. 

 

After seeing this, I heard a quiet clicking sound in my left ear and opened my eyes immediately. So, I am really just wondering if my mind just wandered off or if this could have some meaning that I should look into. I was trying to stop thoughts, so it is hard for me to believe that I would have come up with something like that."

				""Meditation is not sitting down and closing your eyes and sitting to concentrate.  Meditation is the art of observing your world from another space, from the space of all possibilities.  As I speak here I am in meditation:   I'm keeping a consciousness that listens to my voice, that listens to my thoughts, that is aware of what I am saying, aware of the silence inside of me, aware of the peace inside of me, aware of the love for what I am doing and aware of all the possibilities inside.  That is meditative awareness.  



Even as I sit quietly, I begin to observe my thoughts, begin to choose my thoughts - whether it's prayer, whether it's repeating a sacred word, whether it's sending love to my body, whether it's saying a prayer for another person.  Meditation is the art of centering in a space of peace and love and goodness, and focusing on that which is important to you.  



Meditation can happen by sitting with closed eyes, it can happen while speaking, it can happen while eating, it can happen while walking, it can happen while jogging, it can happen while I'm doing my fitness...  In all those times of being one with my activity, being into my activity I'm giving it my full attention and exploring every possibility of relating and bringing out my energy in the best possible wayâ€_I am in meditation.""

sup guys, so i was playing around with visuals in my head and thought of this crazy scenario, keep in mind, i kept the law that says nothing can move faster then light in mind while i visualized this.

so try this for yourselfs and let us know what you think happens and how it happens.



imagine you are floating in space and that you are so huge that the sun and earth are the size of marbles to you,place your hand above the sun and swing your hand towards the earth,how long did it take for your hand to travel from the sun to the earth?like a split second right?in other words it does not take very long at all.from your perspective that is...

now remember that no solid matter can travel faster then light and that it takes about 3 hours for the light emitted from the sun to reeach earth (thats probly not correct,but it does not matter, just roll with it lol)

so now imagine there is a observer floating in space ,he/she is the size of a normal human,and this person is watching everything happen.



now,how long would it take for the large you's hand to reach the earth from the smaller observer's perspective?



i belive that from the small persons perspective your hand would apear to be moving slowly,i say this because if your hand (from the normal sized human's perspective) reached earth in a split second,then it would have to travel faster then light to get there,since light takes about 3 hours to reach earth.



and i belive that from the large you's perspective your hand only took about a split second to reach earth.



you all see the where the mind fk is at right?lol.

the large you's hand takes a split second to reach earth,but in the perspective of a smaller person,it takes alot longer,so within that time frame of your hand traveling from the sun to the earth, the larger you only exsperinced a split second of time passing while the smaller person exsperinced hours of time passing.



its like space and time changes itself based on the perspective of each person,in order to keep the speed of light a constant speed.

And instead of constant progress there seems to be some cycle that lasts at least several weeks.   During part of the cycle meditations go really well and

during other parts of the cycle things are kind of dull and boring.   so over those short periods it seems like one step forward one step back, but I do seem to have been getting somewhere over a much longer time.



I kinda assume biorhythms might  explain something like that, in case you've heard of that.   Again I've been very careful about not trying to find anything out about this cycle so I wouldn't try to sync with it...   but I suppose everyone else would be measuring it to death.



Some of the experiences I've had along the way:  I can get a buzz in my skin kinda related to what happens when you pinch muscles and your arm or leg goes to sleep.  In some way it isn't as intense as that as I've gotten kind of used to it.   The new sensation that came is a similar result to burning off the burning sensation in my throat.  



But again, the drs have something to say about what kind of disease this is,  I don't remember what they called it though.



Who knows, maybe the drs are right and I'm hallucinating.   Certainly I've had way too many synchronicities and my response to that hasn't always been so rational.   But at the same time I can't see how you wouldn't be hallucinating if you did some of the things the masters did in relation to the physical world.   Because I've been yelled at so many times about how it is crazy to do the same thing and expect different results - so based on that obviously I can't do the same thing everyone else is doing unless I want to get the same results everyone else is getting.   And the only way not to be called delusional is to toe the line.  (or do the other thing which is hide everything you are so that noone notices).



Once after fasting I did some breathing exercises and felt that in my whole body.   I was told it was bad to fast and I shouldn't be stressing my body that way though.



I've felt incredible lightness in my arms and legs.   I think I was told that is a disease too.



I've also felt another kind of sensation in the skin, kind of a fast back and forth motion.   Kinda like little rectangles moving back and forth.  Very patterned.   The first time I felt it I happened to be freezing myself.   I'm a very very bad person you see as we all know cold is bad for you.



I've had some success moving 'chi' around.



I can kind of breath through my skin if I work at it.



I've felt waves of energy in my body, kinda like waves in a wave guide.



I get the usual knot in my solar plexus.  Sometimes just above the belly button something happens inside me, a kind of lightness.   It is a nice feeling but I don't know how to describe it.   Airy.   But I'm told it can't happen so I guess I'm supposed to believe it didn't?



the dan tien is nice.  I've just started on that.



I've put a lot of work into stemming the desire to move forward and as a result I have strong interactions with my back.   Some of my best meditations currently come because I concentrate on the back, behind the

solar plexus.   



But of course people around here have explicitly said I shouldn't be using the word 'meditation' because in meditation you just allow things to happen to you, whereas I insist on interacting with my life.   Once again I am a very bad person.



I'm getting kind of used to this, you are just going to tell me everything I'm deciding to do is wrong and/or bad for me and I'm not allowed to use certain words because it is forbidden to use them in any other than the perfect context they were designed for and I'm a very bad person for not towing the line like everyone else does and on and on and on sigh.   But all things told it is no wonder my main mantra seems to be 'noone likes me'.   I just find myself saying it a lot to myself...



my vision has changed in various ways.   Sometimes I've been looking down at a cracked old sidewalk and meditating, and the sidewalk has become a beautiful glowing latticework.   More beautiful than any art I've seen, and at the time I wasn't paying other people my hard-earned money to be able to go to a museum to see it, it was just a part of my life.   So much for the theory that the homeless and poor can't have beautiful things just because the rich deny them decent wages!



And there has been other stuff I've seen but I don't concentrate on vision.   I can sorta 'see' with my eyes closed but it is very murky, I don't do it very well.



I couldn't get rid of paranoia and anxiety...   but it turns out learning to deal with them is a good lesson.   Anxiety causes a kind of vibration in my skin...   so it isn't too hard to make the leap from other things I've said about society's thoughts about what I go through to the idea that this might 

actually be something of interest.  The hardest part is dealing with the fact that when I have anxiety I can't get over thinking how mean people are going to be to me while I feel this way.   But again... if I keep going with the thought that society and I are on opposite sides of the table this at least seems like a reasonable response to something that might actually be interesting 



And so forth.



And there have been a lot of other more mundane feelings that come as I'm trying to reorganize my  existance.   Some good, some not so good."

I normally put on a white noise, I like to use this one a lot:



cannot post link, you need 15 posts.



I start to focus on my breathing, I take a deep breath in through my nose, then out my mouth, I do sometimes find it hard to take a deep breath, as I don't get much exercise as I should. - After a few times of doing that, I breath normally, then I focus on the darkness I see in my eyes. ( I have my eyes shut. ) And I just focus on what I can see, nothing. - After a while, the vision in my shut eyes start to become light, then dark, then light, then dark, like a very slow strobe light, anyone else have this?

Open Meditation.,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100620,"I haven't yet been able to make conversation on meditation, and I'm thinking I'm going about it wrong... but I come across an obstacle where what I talk about isn't what people usually to talk about.  I talk about things differently, but I know what I'm saying, and for the sake of quality discussions, I persist in making new threads.  



I try to deal with reality as it is in life, and steer away from the usual formats of problems and advise, and spiritual experiences, because I believe more in talking things through than having answers.



I want it to be a discussion that leads its own way, and instead of being informed about it, it is realised from the inside - like a 'lightbulb moment'.



My more serious meditation practice involved silence, I mean not talking, and with simple instruction in basic mindfulness, and no jibber jabber, everything arises within myself, so that's how I want the thread to go.



I discourage meditation instruction for these reasons:  too many different kinds of advice are given, and because this an open forum we can't ensure any quality of advice, and therefore, advice tends to be unsound.  We might be able to talk about technique in a more constructive way by talking about deeper implications of the meditation rather than specific techniques or particular kinds of experience.  It's more a topic on meditation and its spiritual implications, rather than how it is done.



I thought I'd start this one by speaking of truthfulness, because it is core to meditation.  The traditions mostly have moral precepts of various sorts, but all of these, and all religious commandments, have truthfulness in common, so that's a good place to begin. This truthfulness is about not lying and being sincere, and mostly, it is a way of discovering the truth about yourself. 



The meditation is self discovery and the purification of mind and body through becoming more deeply aware.  Purification means resolving what people call emotional blocks, or Tolle refers to pain body (people say different things about this), by way of looking deeply into the truth about yourself.  When you look in like this, it is as though the light of conscious awareness shines in and reveals what is there, and as the - I'll just call them obstacles - are dissolved in this way, a more fluid and vital energy flows into that space.  After a time, a significant portion of these obstacles are removed, or dissolved, or fall away (it depends on how each person experiences it and describes it) and one begins to feel a sense of pure love rising up within them.  As J. Krishnamurti put it, ""The flowering of love is meditation"".

"The Naked ""I AM""",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=14435,"The I AM Principle



All beings have an innate, primal sense of Being, a sense of existence, a sense of I AM. This is an intuitive sense of Being, and it represents the one universal truth that all of creation knows: I AM. One need not know ""who"" he is, ""what"" he is, ""where"" he is or ""whence"" he came from in order to have this primal sense of ""I AM."" A spiritual seeker who asserts ""I know nothing"" is actually reinforcing his own sense of Being by pushing against it and ""denying"" what is most obvious: He KNOWS he exists! One can use words to deny existence, but words cannot remove the intuitive knowing of existence itself. You simply ARE!



This I AM Principle is truly universal. Every religion speaks of it in one manner or another. It is mentioned quite a few times in the Bible (""Be still and know that I AM God."" A reference to meditation! ""I AM That I AM."" Etc.); in numerous ancient holy texts of India; in Buddhism; in Taoism; in mystical traditions of all religions where direct inner experience of the Divine is emphasized; in channeled texts such as the Oasphe, Book of Urantia, A Course in Miracles; by great philosophers such as Plato and Socrates; and the list goes on and on and on...



Being a ""Concept Stripper"" (AKA, ""Ooh, baby, work that polarity!"")



""I know nothing except that I AM"" is a most honest statement of self-appreciation and inner recognition, when the spiritual seeker strips away her self-concepts and labels. ""Work that polarity, girl!"" (And guys too!) What does this mean? It means that one can ""strip away"" concepts and duality through playfully dancing around them, and--in a spirit of joy--take a peek behind the stage curtain of illusion that they are. (Shakes: ""All the world is a stage."") Good, evil; right, wrong; this, that; CBS, Charlie Sheen...  These are all polarizations, stage actors in the play of â€œLife on Earth,â€ù and none of these human concepts and roles we create for ourselves truly represent the true state of I AM. For example, whenever you are most joyous, what is it that you are most identified with? Is it actually a person, place or thing that is your true inner focus of Being, or is it really A SENSE OF WELL-BEING that you feel within you, regardless of what your ""outer"" focus is? What happens when we ""step behind"" our own self-concepts? We partake of a sense of Pure Existence, the Naked I AM, free of ""I AM this, I AM that, I AM the Cat in the Hat..."" (I love you, Dr. Suess!) You experience yourself as free of mind concepts, knowing a sense of existence that is undefiled by human perception.



Red Pill, Blue Pill, Red Fish, Blue Fish



Descartes had it backwards! You do not exist because you think, you think because you know that you exist. A pure sense of existence--of I AM-ness--must exist before any thought of ""I am this"" or ""I am that"" can arise. Even the mighty ""Concept Stripper"" cannot hang out with the Naked I AM. He has to go too! The Concept Stripper (AKA the ""Luck Chucker"") throws out all concepts of ""karma"" as well, for there is often too much harm-uh with concepts of karma. Yes, cause and effect is a law of the mind, but it too doesn't represent the Naked I AM. ""What's so great about this 'Naked I AM,' anyway?"" some spiritual seekers cry out. Well, that's the thing! It is not even ""great,"" at least not in a sense that the human consciousness can understand. In this game I'm playing here, ""great"" too is chucked out the window. ""Is it really naked?"" Okay, let's chuck that one too! So what is left? ""I AM?"" You ask, who is this ""I"" that can exist? There is no real ""I"" that the human mind can know. It can believe it knows concepts and things, while the only true knowing that consciousness has is intuitive, natural, primal and original as a sense of Being. Even a subatomic particle knows it exists. How? Because it exists! I didn't say it exists AS a ""subatomic particle,"" however. The appearance of a ""subatomic particle"" is just an appearance, and is not what IT really is. IT doesn't really think nor know ITself as a ""subatomic particle."" ""IT"" (or God, Pure Awareness, etc.) doesn't label ITself with such human concepts, but knows ITself as ITself, infinitely whole. All labels and concepts are not Original to the Naked I AM.



""Drop IT like IT's hot!""



Uh oh! Here comes Mr. Concept Stripper again! He says, ""But wait, I'm not done! Even 'IT' is too hot to handle! Drop IT like IT's hot, Simon Karlos!'"" (Cue Matrixy techno music: Junkie XL - Blue Pill, Red Pill http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhR3_Gp3nQQ )

As is my usual fashion, I'm starting this conversational thread.  It's not a question/answer - help/advice paradigm that evokes a hierarchy experts and novices; it's formed in recognition of equality where each person is the expert of their own awareness and experience. No-one can do you as well as you can.  



It's not a discourse that's supposed to influence people, and in terms of it helping, I merely trust that the unfolding dialogue will be a beneficial one.



We can continue without pre-intentions that set up expectations and I don't know the answers, but I am here alive - life which animates body and brings this momentary experience into conscious awareness - which is to say, this is not other than meditation. The conversation requires ones conscious presence and full attention.  If not - why should anyone speak if others aren't fully present and attentive to what they have to say? How better to show ones compassionate nature and respect another than to be completely present and pay them close attention? How other can one be supportive to another but to be there in all sincerity?  



I want anyone to be able to speak as they will without being subjected.  I want people to speak as explorers of themselves, and also the self they are discovering.  Each one has a different experience that isn't the seeking of experience, but the presence of the experience and the miracle of conscious awareness...



The meditation conversation is one that necessarily brings about the meditative mind as it requires close attention and necessitates one be consciously present, and it is formed with the mutual respect inherent in these things.

Meditation when ill,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=59716,"I've been told by my yoga/tai chi teacher that it's not good to practice when developing a cold, as the energy circulating round the body tends to drive the virus round and feed it so that it develops faster and more virulently. 



Apart from feeling under par, how do you feel about meditating whilst ill? I wondered if it mattered what type of meditation you do whilst fighting off a virus etc. At present I have a cold that is quite different from the usual snuffling and coughing, and I lost my voice for 24 hours or so.

I try to do 20-40 minutes a day, but I've missed a couple too. My question is in regards to breathing. I am aware that during this time I breath a bit deaper and possibly a little faster. After about 15minutes My whole body tingles like pins-n-needles. I know that this is the effect of highly oxygenated blood flowing through the body, something that happens to people who are hyperventilating. I experience more or less of this in every meditation practice, so my question is if my breathing needs to be changed? Thnx."

I have no idea how to get into the stage where you feel ""light"" and totally relaxed. I always get stuck and bored, then I just want to fall asleep. 



After all, the music I was listening to helped me to drift off, but only when I didn't concentrate on it.

Its very hard to explain, its as if everything inside of me just switches to hyperdrive and I have this sensation of being sucked out of the top of my head. This lasts for only a few moments and is immediately cut off when I start to feel intense panic and open my eyes. My heart rate literally skyrockets at this point and takes a few minutes to calm back down.

The physical side of meditation,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=58837,"Been meditating for about six months, and I know that at first I was neglecting the physical side of it - all my attention was in my mind, no wonder it was so frustrating to begin with.



Took a break from meditation recently, but I've started doing it again and it's made me realise how important it is to really inhabit your body when you meditate - you aren't going to get much out of it if there's a lot of stress and tension in your body, imo, so you've got to transmute that by making it conscious. This is why observing the breath is so important, too, as if your breathing's consistent and steady, you'll be more relaxed.



Honestly, I think many people who are new to meditation (and even some people who aren't) tend to overlook the physical aspect and see it as being a mental process."
Pulsing Forehead,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=98024,"Several years ago, I tried meditating for the first time using headphones and some kind of shaman drumming recording.  After some time, I began to get a pulsing sensation right above and between my eyebrows, like this kind of pressure followed by a ""pop"" and then building again.



I would imagine that this was somewhere along the lines of 6 years ago now.  Since then I've meditated a ton, using different techniques, but each time, the pulsing is there.  If I chanted for a while, and stopped, the pulsing would hit after about a minute, and become so intense that my face would scrunch up into a strange expression.  It wasn't painful or anything, quite the opposite really - I'd feel on the cusp of a state of euphoria.  I've experienced the edge of that euphoric state only a few times.



It's not really my goal.  I don't know what my goal is really, maybe an OBE, or maybe just to get some visuals or visions or insights.  Of course, to relax myself and improve my stress resistance too.  These days I can get the pulsing just by willing it or thinking about it.  As I type this now, I feel the pressure and popping beginning.



Can anyone explain what this phenomenon is and if it has some significance to something I'm not quite attaining, and what's your opinion on what I should do differently.  I try to just let my mind go blank and chant, or listen to drumming... I try not to see with my eyes (though they're closed) but with my mind.  I try to go into a different state of consciousness.  But many times I just end up relaxing so much that I fall asleep."

I would say it was over a month ago (maybe 2 months) that I meditated about life and my job. My job has been quite the spiritual journey itself.

I was in the middle with a graduate cap and gown on and there was what must have been one of my spirit guides. I looked around the forest and I noticed how far I had come because the forest was lit, except for the very tip which meant to me that I just had a little more to go (last time I meditated it was all lit like I completed it...but I am still working there so maybe it's a matter of letting go...Anyway, I did some reiki on certain areas of the forest just intuitively.

"Help: Insomnia form meditation,Deep Trance state, Super consciousness?",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=96841,"Hello,

I think meditation is causing me insomnia.

I have been meditating regularly for the past 3-4 months, for at least 20 minutes.

My technique was always to focus on the surrounding and sounds, and just observing, letting all thoughts and feelings just stream away. 

Recently I have started to really get the hang of getting in to a really deep state, I am also using now binural beats when meditating to get into that deep state. 



The past 2 days I was able to meditate for 2-3 hours, and really quieting the mind down, almost to the point where mind chatter is gone, only observing the sound of the beats, or the inner feelings of the body and emotions. Some times the chatter is really loud and random, but I don't pay attention to it



This state of deepness is very blissful and relaxing and has expanded to even beyond meditation, where I can be not thinking in daily activities, like making dinner, only focusing on sounds and visuals around me.



But the problem is when I lay down, and try to fall asleep, I can't, I just relax really deeply, just like meditation, my whole body is tranquil and the, the mind is chattering but I do not focus on it, I cannot fall asleep and become unconscious, rather I feel Super conscious, aware of every sound or feeling in my body. I can lay for 3 hours not moving, but cant fall asleep.

Shifting focus between the in and out.



Also sleep has become very deep when I sleep, nothing can wake me up.

It seems as though the border between consciousness and unconsciousness has gotten stronger.



I still feel tired, and being in this meditative state does not replace sleep.



what are the things, techniques I can try when I am at the meditative state when trying to fall asleep.

Also if someone shared similar experience and would like to share.

Also any information regarding altering this state of consciousness would be appreciated.

Thanks"

So this time, I decide to meditate using some music from YouTube, the title says something about Theta waves.



After some time of trying to empty my mind, I'm eventually almost fully cleared of it. It feel appropriate to say some affirmations out loud, which I do. Then I ask for guidance from my guardian angels, or whatever else they are called. Eventually, I reach a point where I'm truly thinking about nothing except the back thought of the rythm of the music, to which I'm paying no attention. 



I open my eyes. A few moments later, a sharp pain shoots above my left eye and under my left eyebrow. It wasn't unpleasant, nor did it feel truly physical. I guess it was like pressure. This ""pressure"" widens to the whole lower forehead region, but mainly near my left eye/eyebrow. (At that moment, I think, ""is this my third eye opening?) I then see in front of my eyes a weird figure, a sketch of light, which makes me think of a lion, for unknown reasons. The sketch momentarily resembles 2-3 beings, looking back at me, but then it goes back to being an incomprehensible sketch. This goes on for a few moments until I decide to stop.



Can anybody explain my experience? Does it have anything to do with my third eye? I have been craving its opening for the last three years but haven't been able to put too much effort into it. Or does it have to do with my guardian angel(s)?

Greetings and blessings of love and light.



I have seeded this thread under the category of meditations in order to provide an ongoing supplement to support the progressive relationship between you and your spirit team. Through my words and suggestive meditations I will attempt to bring you closer to your angels and guides through meditational exercises.



In response to growing interest in meditative practice as a route of Self-empowerment I would like to set aside a singular thread dedicated to such. In this space I will share with you some of my own meditations focused on specific desires. They will be anything from healing to contacting a deceased loved one. From invoking an angel to expanding your awareness and capacity for love.



I will endeavour to expand on this thread and make available new meditations as time permits. I share them with the highest respect to your journey and in light of your needs. I hope you find them useful and recommend them to others.



<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>



Basics.



Before using my meditations you may wish to follow your own routine to relax you for the journey ahead. When you have set aside enough time and space for your session you will want to ensure you will not be interrupted for at least half an hour.



You will want to initiate a comfortable position and prepare your physical space to your needs. You may also wish to play some subtle background music to aid in your relaxation. Natural harmonious music is preferred.



Begin your personal routine of relaxation and enter your state of deep inner-awareness. If you do not have a personal routine of relaxation seek guidance from meditational practitioners for one best suited for you.

Bring the breath into focus and allow it to bring your mind, body and spirit into harmonious sync. Use the breath to calm the mind into gentle stillness.



If you so wish, you may want to begin your meditation journey with a simple 10 minute chakra exercise. This will maximise your energy flow and boost the efficiency of your third eye and receptive nodes.



Rather than write such a mediation here I will simply provide a link to a standard guided chakra meditation. (Not my own)

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>



Now you may embark upon your meditational journey. Holding the intent to do so from your highest concept of love.



We will begin by using Sparrowâ€™s traditional journey to your special sacred island. From here you will visit your divine inner temple and experience its many wonders.



The meditation will be in two parts. Since you will be returning back to your divine temple many times to explore the many other rooms and potentials I will start part 2 after you have arrived there. In future meditations I will ask you to follow part 1 of this meditation to get to your sacred temple.







<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>



The Eye of Clarity



The Eye of Clarity is a sacred tool used in the spirit realm to look deep into your very soul. It is a tool for a variety of purposes. These include:

Finding a solution to a pressing issue in your life.

Finding love, peace and forgiveness.

Understanding something from a higher, more loving perspective.

Revealing the true nature behind your deepest fears.

Revealing your soul destiny.



Let us begin.



Part 1:



It is a warm and pleasant day, as you find yourself sitting upon a beach of beautiful white sand. 

There is a gentle breeze and the sun is just right, just how you like it.

As you sit you feel the soft grains of pure white sand between your fingertips.

You glance around and notice you are the only one here. You have the whole beach to yourself.

A few yards ahead you observe the waves of the ocean so calm and peaceful.

The ocean appears so still and silent, the water seems to glow a brilliant pure luminous blue.







Today is a special day. Today you are going to your special island.

It is a place of many mystical and magical things. 

It is the home of your sacred temple.



As you gaze off into the ocean expanse you begin to make out a shape off into the distance.

As you sit comfortably and peacefully on the beach you patiently stare out at this hazy object.

As it moves closer and closer you begin to recognise it as a small wooden boat.

In the boat stands a figure. The figure appears to be gracefully wielding a long wooden paddle.

As the boat comes closer and closer into view you suddenly recognise the figure.

It is one of your spirit guides. 









You shake yourself off from the white sand and walk over to meet your spirit guide.

They have a big smile on their face and obviously very happy to see you.

â€˜Are you ready?â€™ says your guide.

You nod and climb on board the small boat aided by your guide.

Without saying anything more your guide begins to paddle, again gracefully and seemingly effortlessly.

They seem to know intuitively where you want to go as they look out into the distance.

You sit down in the boat and relax as you watch the beach behind you fade slowly out of sight.



It feels like only minutes have passed yet the beach you left behind is nowhere to be seen.

Yet ahead of you now a form starts to emerge into view. 

It is a small isolated island with a beautiful white sandy beach like the one you had left behind.

There are trees covering the whole surface of the island concealing its many wonders.



The boat stops next to a long wooden platform leading down to the beach.

â€˜We have arrivedâ€™ your guide informs you, as they step out onto the platform.

As you step off the boat and walk down the platform your guide walks behind you allowing you to lead the way.

You reach the beautiful white sandy beach and notice another path leading up some stone steps into the trees.

As you walk the steps you are lead along a path to an opening through the trees.

Here, you suddenly behold the most beautiful temple you have ever seen.

The walls appear to be made of white gold stone and shimmer in the sunlight.

The temple stands high into the sky above the treetops and you feel dwarfed by its incredible size. 

Huge pillars of stone mark the entrance to this sacred temple.

This is your temple. Created by and dedicated to you.

Your sacred spiritual portal to many magical places.



Part 2:



As you enter your sacred temple you find yourself in a spacious hall with corridors leading in every direction. 

You have the sense that this place is limitless.

You ascend some polished stone steps in the centre of the hallway and find yourself at another junction.

There is a path to the right and to the left and more steps directly ahead which lead down into a smaller hallway.

Today you are going to follow the path to the right. You step up some golden white steps through an archway.

The archway leads further upwards along a spiralling stone staircase. Up, up, up.

At the top of the stone steps is a vast corridor. It appears to go on and on infinitely.

Along the corridor you see many doorways.

As you walk along the corridor your spirit guide directs you to the first door to your left. 

Your guide tells you this is as far as they go, and that they will meet you down in the main hallway when you are ready to leave.









You say goodbye to your guide and watch them disappear down the spiralling steps.

Facing the doorway now, you see an insignia of an eye upon the door.

You push open the large double door and step inside.



You walk into a beautiful dome shaped room. The walls are constructed of exquisite picturesque glass of various art forms.

Rays of dazzling white light seems to seep through the painted glass walls towards the centre of the room.

In the centre stands a large stone carving, with the words â€˜The eye of clarityâ€™ carved upon its surface.









Every ray of light appears to shine upon the stone.

The room appears to be empty apart from a large glass door behind the stone.

As you approach it you notice the door appears to be alive.

It appears like liquid glass or crystal and you observe ripples that move as if made of water.

You realize it is a very special door.

Only those who have the purest intent and sincere heart may enter this room.

You embrace the love in your heart and focus on your intent for clarity and wisdom.

As you do you begin to observe the structure of the door alter in shape.

It rapidly melts away and transforms into a beautiful radiant angel of light.



The angel greets you and permeates tremendous love and compassion for you.

The angel guides you into the next room.



The room takes the form of yet another dome. Only this time the dome is significantly greater in size.

The room is empty except for a silvery crystalline glass stand and globe in the centre

The entire room is covered in luminescent square tiles, as if some form of matrix or grid .

The angel hovers next to the crystalline glass globe upon the stand.

â€˜This is the eye of clarityâ€™ the angel explains.

â€˜The eye will reveal to you exactly what you need to seeâ€™.

The angel directs you now to place your hands upon the globe.

As you do it begins to respond to your touch and images begin to form within the globe.

As they do the entire grid of the dome amplifies the image all around you.

The dome looks deep into your very soul and penetrates your most stubborn walls and fears.

It peers deeply within your very spirit. It sees everything about you.

Every desire. Every thought. Every feeling.

The angel speaks again. â€˜seeâ€_â€_â€™.

The globe begins to project images and sounds all around you, across the entire grid.









You feel as if you are in the very centre of what you are observing.

Yet you feel safe, secure and loved. You feel compassion and tremendous understanding of what you are witnessing.

You feel as if you are an observer looking down upon a vast world below your feet.

You feel like a god. From this perspective you see everything so clear, so transparent, so vivid.

Allow it now to show you something in your life which you need to understand.

It could be a fear. It could be a painful past experience. It could be an element of your spiritual development.

Focus now. Focus on the globe, and see.

See what you need to see.

Feel the unconditional love and compassion from your beloved angel as it oversees your wellbeing. 

It assists you in what you need to see.

As you witness the images and sounds before you focus on its meaning.

What lesson are you here to learn? What do you understand from this?

What mistakes have you made? What must you do to resolve any issues you may have?

What must you do to evolve and develop your soul?

Allow the globe to provide the answer.

Again, you are merely a witness, so simply observe this from a state of pure love and acceptance.



When you have finished and are ready your angel will turn off the globe.

The room will resume its original appearance and you will feel a sense of profound wisdom and clarity.

Your angel informs you that it is time to go.

So thank your angel for its assistance and say goodbye.



Make your way back out of the dome, and back through the first room past the stone carving.

Exit the room and close the door behind you.

Make your way down the corridor and down the spiralling steps.

Return back to the main hall of your temple where your spirit guide awaits.



Follow your guide out of your sacred temple, along the path and back onto the white sandy beach.

Walk across the wooden platform back to the boat that awaits.

When you are ready your guide will take you back.

Back across the water to the original beach where you had first met.



Wave goodbye to your spirit guide and thank them for accompanying you today.

You will see them again soon.



Bring yourself back to your waking state and out of meditation. 

Focus on the breath.

Allow yourself time to become aware of your surroundings.

Ground yourself as necessary.

Being in the darkness the level of melatonin soars then a pinoline stage is reached then the 5-MeO-DMT stage. If one stays 9 days or more a DMT stage is reached.



I have only found dark retreats in Thailand, southern Mexico and Guatemala. The latter two I do not know how safe I will be in that part of the those countries. I am hoping for something closer. 



Anybody know of any dark retreats in the U.S., Canada, or Europe?"
Saw a magenta light,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=13284,Sometimes when i meditate i'll get quick flashes of images. briefly. when this happens i usually know it's not just my mind playing tricks. there's a certain abruptness to them. well today i was meditating and i had the longest image ever out of nowhere. the only light i've ever seen while meditating was quick white flashes but i have to be meditating for quite sometime and getting a little bit deeper than usual to experience this. well today i saw a small magenta light. it didn't take up my whole field of vision. i was looking around for information on this and i read something about someone reading about sometimes neurons can be firing off or something. although it was moving a bit and it was quite different from what i usually experience. i didn't feel anything but i was quite in awe afterward and quite excited. i know eastern spirituality acknowledges the magenta chakra but western really doesn't. just wondering if anybody else has ever seen magenta at all and what it might mean. any possible information or input would be quite beneficial. i'm just really curious about the color.
World Peace And Healing Meditation,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=100404,"You are all invited to join in a Worldwide Peace And Healing Meditation to heal the problems of the world and to bring peace to humanity and the planet.



The meditation is held at 1.00 pm your own local time (wherever in the world you are), every week from Saturday 30th April 2016, lasting 25 minutes.



The meditation is to focus on specific problems in the world and to try to change mens hearts to bring a healing to them. We should concentrate on a problem that we are impressed to focus on and we should all send unconditional love to the perpetrators of the problem and the world leaders, trying to help the angels turn them away from their greed, lust, power seeking oppression and violence, and turn their hearts instead towards love, peace harmony and the nurture of God's creation, instead of the destruction. That is the only way forward.



The meditation, because of the time difference spreads over 24 hours of focussed Divine Love, Light and Healing Energies and the angels and spirit workers gather the energies that are sent out and focus them on the important areas. A focussed energy on specific areas and in this way we help the angels, with our love, to do their work. A bit like a searchlight in an evening sky.



It would be nice if you could help.



Blessings

Thoughtlessness,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=14735,"How do you acheive this state?





I used to practice Raja Yoga and got to a point where I could stop my thoughts with an effort of will for as long as I wanted at any moment.  But it felt so forced, and I felt at times as though in my meditations I was focusing so much on not-thinking that I was missing the point of thoughtlessness, I was missing the awareness.  The same went for my daily life, I would be able to stay thoughtless but not fully aware of my surroundings.





These days I find that by surrendering, allowing myself to stay in the present, and accepting all things, and I enter a state of thoughtless awareness without even trying.  When I meditate I just sit and see my thoughts as sounds in my head, like a bird chirping outside, and they go away in no time.  When they come back in meditation from time to time they are like sounds and just come and go like any other external sound.





It would seem to me that it is not so much about not thinking as it is about seperating ""you"" from thought... when this happens you may have thoughts still but not thinking happens as a natural occurence, instead of a forced effort.  And what's best is it requires no effort whatsoever lol, once you view thought as sound that you observe in your head it just fades away into emptiness."

Can meditation be dangerous?,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=94053,"I learnt the hard way, yes meditation can be dangerous, if one does more than 20 minutes.  It can leave a person with groundless feeling or the 'Meditation Uncalm Feeling' which I've had for more than a year now.  The meditation uncalm feeling is like a horrible feeling in the stomach area which is like exaggerated worry and anxiety and fear.  To get rid of this feeling I have to do the 'I Am' Mantra meditation.



I use to meditate by looking at the sky all day every day for four months.  I found that by focusing on the sky, I could blank out my mind and stop thoughts.   Don't ask my why I did something so stupid, it just felt good and peaceful at the time."
miss hepburn and other none dualistic members,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=98330,"so i have been practicing meditation for about a year now and it involves just going to my bedroom and just sitting on my bed, no devices laptop,mobile,ecig,book etc so its ""me just being"". however i have this thing called lower ego who always trys its hardest to distract me and does quite a good job i must say. anyway there is days i just fall deeply into the silence and the warmth and welcoming of feeling home is something else, i ""notice"" even before falling into this silence that this ""me"" tries is hardest to escape the present, i ""notice"" it dying to reach for a phone a laptop or anything for distraction any attempt to avoid ""what is"" this week i have started using visualizations during meditation and its difficult to do this as i find myself wondering of elsewhere, im hoping this improves because i read somewhere if you hold a positive thought for 17 seconds it attaches other thoughts to it .



now when im at work or driving i find that this seems to be when this turd called ""lower ego"" sneaks up on me and its like being trapped between i lions jaws , at these times i find it really difficult to keep an eye on this little thing and somehow it sneaks in and bites me on the thing, i think its a focus thing myself as i find it difficult to keep a eye on it when driving or working so if anyone can give some pointers to crush this little thing  at times like at work or driving. much appreciated"

Singing bowl questions,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=93270,"I have been a fan of listening to singing bowls on YouTube and finally bought some of my own today. One is a small (size of your hand) Tibetan bowl and the other is pretty big (about the size of a big mixing bowl). The big one isn't a Tibetan one, I forget where she said it was made, but it's not crystal either. Anyway, my questions are;



I can't get the small one to sing, but the big one works fine. Is this because the smaller decorative ones aren't made for singing? You can tap it and it makes the chime sound but for the life of me I can't get it to sing by rubbing the rim. It was $45 at a holistic expo (same place I bought the big one, but a different exhibitor). My big one was $300. Which brings me to my next question;



I know I sound like a cheapskate but is there any place that has big ones cheaper than $300? I want to have a set, preferrably one for each chakra. But I can't afford to spend $2000 on these things. Which brings me to my last question, lol;



Do you get the same benefit from listening to them on YouTube videos as you do from having one physically next to you? I do love feeling the vibration but like I said, $2000 to buy a whole set is just crazy. How do they expect the average person to be able to enjoy these, most people can't even afford ONE of them. But with only one you're only helping that chakra, right? You need one for each one so they're all balanced correctly?"
"Meditating, How is your meditation experience?",http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=59321,"When i was 10 years old my family was going through alot of hard times, I had become so stressed I was sick all the time, I cried all the time not knowing the reasons, I had a horrible temper, and I did not socialize with anybody because I felt like the misfit for having a bad home life. Then one day at a family in the summer my great grandma sat me down and began talking to me about life, she made me realize that tomarrow is a new day and that I didnt need to stress the way I was. I didnt really know how I would begin to heal my wounds, so I asked her for advice, she suggested meditation. She walked me through saying, ""Get comfy, relax yourself and begin to fall asleep, when you are at the stage of being aware of your surroundings, but about to fall asleep start letting go of every thought besides the word PEACE, it doesnt matter if things pop into your head that you dont recall thinking, just end the thought with PEACE."" Soon enough I had felt like I was dreaming while I was awake, my mind was clear, I was relaxed, I felt refreshened, the only thoughts that ever popped up in my mind were very productive, I was guiding myself. I stopped midway through and asked her how it is supposed to feel and she said, ""Only you will know how it feels, everybody is different.""

       I have been using the same method ever since, occasionally I use crystals, but the original way is perfect for me. I dont really have to many people to share this with, so I honestly dont know how many others meditation experiences are? Please share!:)"
An odd experience to share,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=14736,"After trying several places with different orientations to start with my practice of meditation I decided to do it by myself. 

 

Why? 

Because I did not find love and compassion in the places I went. I did not find a loving attitude to receive newcomers. I noticed that they just wanted to keep their machine moving, they were stuck on their doctrines, usually believing that they are unique, of course, the best of the best.

 

In this moment I want to focus my practice on contacting my guides. 

 

After assuming that I should begin alone, maybe with some guide provided by a book or even by the internet, I has a couple of good experiences that I see as successful, but the latter was very odd. 

 

The facts: 

 

At the very beginning I gave, as taught, a big importance to the environment, the posture, etc. you know, as most of the guiding texts about meditation suggest. I looked for a secluded corner at home and just began.

 

I had a good meditation there, and I could visualize what was necessary to contact higher frequencies. 

 

Yesterday, however, I was alone in the kitchen, a place I like very much, and I began to read an orientation text and noticeably, I could accomplish all the steps to meet my main guide, and talk with him. It was an amazingly moving experience.

 

I was sitting on a chair, in a rather odd position, with an overwhelming emotion, crying of emotion, reading from time to time the following step suggested in the text, and coming back to meditation and making contact again for the next question to my guide. When I finished I felt a huge sense of peace but also, I could not stop feeling emotion.

 

And here is my question:

 

From what I tell, do you think that I actually went into a good meditation, even though it was not done strictly by the book? Do meditative position and place count? 

 

I would like to know your view on pros and cons of doing like that.

 

Love and light,

TISS"
My Brilliant mind! (Or is it?) :-),http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=10577,"I've recently wondered how brilliant my mind might be, I once told soemone I can do anything with my mind, and he seemed quite shocked.. 



But anyway I can:





Rewind Time

Hyperspace Myself

Hyperspace Others

Take Huge Bounds

Heat Things (I can heat my own body or your body to burn the fingers of the aggressor with their hands on you or me.)

Morph Myself back together should I get destroyed

Morph You back together should you get destroyed

Morph you into something all powerful and beautiful.

Create Beautiful gardens or scenery

Create Beautiful women!

I can convert an attack on myself into energy for myself or others.

I can peer at a dangerous scene without having to go there.

I (I think) can see a persons true character in a kind of symbolistic image (Most are glowing with love and warmth but some are like two headed dragons!)

I can create energy for myself with rythm!

I can create fire!

I can love! I can fill you with love!

I can enlist the help of wild life.

I can enlist the help of...? ? ? all space and time?

I can produce hundreds of clones of myself.

I can clone others aswell.

I can saturate my enemies with dilemmas/problems.

I can do terribly callous things, but good men put things right and do no harm right?

I can move anything or anyone.

(I think) I can hear what people have thought, not what they are thinking in the present, but what they have thought in the past, this seems a bit unreliable though. ****** maybe this is just me decoding or something??******

I can swim through water at spectacular speed.

Basically I can do almost anything, it seems I can't fly...not yet anyway!



The reason I've mentioned this is to get an idea of brilliant my mind might be...is it more brilliant than yours...less brilliant?



I can basically bring absolutely anything into fruition with my mind...



I thankyou for reading this..

Being brave to ask this..,http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=99958,"Hello all, 

I have a question but I'm not sure if this is the correct thread. But I feel like I should ask this. The way I view and receive things is through mental images,wether my eyes are open or closed. While meditating, sometimes I feel like I'm being pulled deeper within myself instead of out and toning in on my awareness. When this happens I sometimes get images...of this being, but I feel like I know them? From the quick images I get, their skin tone is like a Casper the ghost white. And their eyes are this deep blue color. Almost like blue sapphire. I haven't really got a glimpse of their hair yet. But they are definitely female.They always have a very huge glow of energy around them. Very bright light.



When I get these images they are normally always sitting in one spot,sometimes their eyes are closed, sometimes open. They even give me a warm smile sometimes.they feel very bright and loving,nurturing. Anywho..my silly question is could this be my higherself that I'm seeing? It feels like it's apart of me somehow. 



Feels like it's not a outside source. Or is my imagination just very vivid like it's been for years?   I don't get images of this being unless I'm meditating. Or thinking of them ( like I am now,but that's only cause I had to remember what I've seen about her)"
