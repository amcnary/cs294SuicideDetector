 this week will be the first week so i don't expect her to miss her to much just yet
whoops
 i'm broken and alone
  i can only seem to remember the one that involved an outburst
 somehow i'm still here
 they won't take me to see a therapist anymore because the last therapist i went to didn't help me
 but i could tell they didn't want me sitting with them
 she doesn't need to have to worry about me too
 but have it known i did the same to her
 that was strange
 i saw my doctor about it
 my brothers would be pissed
 oh my god
 she then spotted a man in an orange suit and told me to run after me
 and not what others expect
 isn't such a failure of a human being doing everyone a favour by taking herself out of their way
 i don't think i'd even leave a note
 that i was not meant to be on this earth
  i'm not enough
but i did kind of flip my shit on her
 i have re-evaluated my maturity and unblocked everything because i know i am a survivor
 i knew she often ran out of minutes so i didn't think much of it
 and i thought i had it covered when i gave myself more insulin before i went to bed
 im just desperate to keep myself occupied at the moment
 she had been committing self-harm
the weird thing is that i work in mental health
so i guess this is already point two
my shovel
 they were all coherent
i thought that my childhood was normal until about a month ago
 there are times i don't want to hang out with friends or family just to get a"fix" i'm at a loss
 my screen reader slows down to a crawl and is barely able to function
 i can't bare to see happy families who have vacations
 i still have my dentist here
 i've made it to my 30s
 nausea
 still a long
 i will try to respond to in the next entry
 but their gravestones and family grief is very real regardless of what the numbers don't say and government tries to cover up
 i didn't feel the dark cloud over my head that has followed me for so long
 please have someone who can see describe the screen for us
 i get so sick when i get too close and that's not fair i have to be 26 and be so dead afraid of a school i left when i was 14
 i can't say i'm on a holiday i have no money and i don't even drive to say i'm on a local get away
 i don't think i can get any disease just from close contact
 i don't know what's wrong with me
 i don't even mind spending over an hour combing every burr out of her mane and tail
nothings really changed
i use to think this friendship was a two way street but even before she started work things were starting to feel like i one way street
 and i witness this sickening show too regularly for me to handle
"still confused"
 to any one
sooner i hope
 but no
 i'm a manipulative bastard
 i am no good
 i should probably add stop sleeping 10-12 hours a day to the list
every single one blabbed
 but i need to get over my mortal fear
 but i see he's losing his patience
  so i texted her about it
 am i crazy
 i lost 65 pounds
  then we drifted apart pretty fast
chronic pain sucks so bad sometimes
 then failing multiple classes
 naturally
 what exactly did i do wrong
 she reluctantly agreed with me
 it wasn't any more than i normally would have done when she was talking to me
 it's changed a lot
 i just wish i had someone anyone that actually wanted to talk to me
 as i said
 and explained to her why can't make the appointment
 out of spite to them or because i was spoiled when young
 so i would never give her up
 18 month license suspension
 he's getting desperate)
 i think they cause most of the anxiety
 the thought of suicide is tempting not just end it all but to not feel so used up anymore
 i feel damn lonely
but i think every on has their limits i'm sure and i can't help but feel i'm being taken advantage of a bit
i hate her
 i call it like i see it
sorry if this wasn't the right place for this 
 when i am with my horse
 and won't listen when mum tells her not to chase the dog around the house
 its like everytime im alone dark
 he said he doesn't know how to get rid of them
 stopped therapy and meds as my doctors kept cancelling my appointments
 much worse than mine
 i'm just in a lot of pain
"i know what you've been doing
 it has 305
i've spent all week trying new methods of getting a new pc because this laptop is fucking horrible and does nothing but give me grief
 i don't know what to think about all of this
  i have yet to have a friendship out here
rant over~
 it's more a problem that i don't really see myself getting to know any people outside uni either
 i just wish i wasn't me
so i need ideas as to why i can't do this and i can't think of any so if anybody has some ideas  please share them with me
 and he's build me up from the bottom
 but i'm okay
 just hope i dont have any panic attacks or piss off other people with my moods
 really struggling financially
it is like an endless battle within me
work
 i had told the ear doctor about my fears and she was really nice about it
  and maybe put up a sign telling students how to complain
 my issues aren't fit for someone who isn't a professional
 i dont know what to do
 some of them are laughable
 look hes upset with you
 eat pills
i am just sick and tired of people disapproving of everything about me
i started to get excited when i saw 'suicide
 now have no reason in the world to care
 i haven't talked to a doctor about it since then
 i do not fear death
 when i saw her picture it triggered me so much all i wanted to do was do the same to my body
 i probably make another thread
  i didn't tell her specifically to keep it a secret
 and my boyfriend too
 i'll always want to die
 i have to be the mediator
 (technically legally you're not allowed to let a dog loose on public ground though) but no one ever comes there
 but not to people that know me 
 i want to cover the whole range
ive been tearing up at my desk for hours now
 just seeing myself shutting down and getting away from people already and take down that fence in my mind that has built in to keep things running smoothly and voices at bay
 and asked if we could do it
so uhm
 tonight i'm bawling
 but i kept a brave face
 and she stopped responding to my texts
but sorry is only a word and not comforting or helpful
 but i didnt realize she wanted to go hunting also and didnt think i had the energy to do so
so this person got her own horse
 but if i try to look into the future i just see the same void i expect to see in my past
 i know but it doesn't make it any less real but please tell the anxiety that
 they always disappear when my grandpa tries to get them
 at least we don't have to be alone
 whether extreme or moderate or mild
 i don't know if i've done the right thing by telling them
 why
 helping my mum extra in the kitchen so my mum would get less frustrated about my aunt
 geez
so if i'm so awful
this year i've started to do things for myself instead of trying to please others
or she won't listen to me about somthing
 i was conversing with a friend of mine
 the other problem is that on top of the fact that i feel like a failure
 i've distanced myself from everyone again
 i don't know if i should leave or stay
 but my aunt never remembers to close the door behind her
 and has a horrible way of managing thoughts
 tired of anxiety and not being comfortable in my body
 this boy who i knew came up to me and asked if he could sit with us
 people i could talk to when i was down and count on them to pick me back up again
 i'm off to the geek squad at bestbuy
 at school
 because there wouldn't be enough time to talk with people anyway (also most don't even live in my city and just commute here during the semester)
 i barely ever go out
ps: i'm not new on the forum but i have been inactive for more than a half year now
 let's just say he did things that no man should do anyone  let alone to a child
  later i found out my parents had lied and knew of my upcoming move
 that i wasn't aware of immediately because my statement comes in a format i can't read
i find it hard enough to say what i need and want as it is
 he must be tired of you
 i'm tired of feeling like this
 not sure how
 small things like me going to get her coat from my mum's bedroom
 fear
 and physically ill due to workplace bullying
 here i sit alone in my darkness wondering how i became
 it's really painful
 ever since the media got involved
 disgusted with my body i was
 or even miscarried
 but yes i know i must trudge on because things will get better
 because it's just how my body naturally is
 hug the cliff's but i wouldn't dare put other people in harms way
 but it's not like people go there to talk with other people and get to know them
 well i fucking know that
 on the other hand
 but currently i'm regular like clockwork
 it's in my ear and my other teeth hurt
 i just never got them refilled
 i wish i didn't feel like such a failure
 because theirs seem entirely biological or chemically-based
 though i already think i might need much more than that
she wrote the hold and i eventually left before police could arrive to stop me
i was out shopping today and happened to glance into a full length mirror
 but when it comes back
  and all of this i would like to end
 but never anyone my age that i could actually trust
 i know there are no answers
i don't know what to do anymore
 i take pills every 5 hours
 i sometimes get angry
 i am so tired but i cannot stop
 but everywhere i go failure is my outcome
 is it too hard
 i just signed a lease to stay through july 2017
 i tell them how i feel and they tell me to suck it up
 last year was the peak
 if i survive until then i will graduate in a couple years
 nothing i attempted could manage to bring my focus in long enough to be productive
  been trying to go through with the day keeping myself busy but sleeping wasn't possible when thinking of her not breathing or being warm next to me anymore
 my mom is always drunk and puts me and everyone else down
 two women had found the road and decided to walk it with their tiny dog
it has been awhile since i have posted
i want to get off the ride now
 but my mental health has in all honesty worsened
i visited and had a meeting with a young woman there over a month ago
 when i explained the problem
 why is that so hard
 2016
so why waste precious oxegyen
why am i always the one at fault
i just wish i knew what to do to stay safe
 two days ago i guess i crossed a line trying to hug him
 and even if i have to leave in a body bag
 and by then i will have just killed myself
 but it turned out to be a cruel lie
 my anxiety kills me
 i want to be
 i guess i mainly need to vent
 i also don't trust the so-called professionals and am also skeptical of how effective the medicine really is
 the damned thing crawls under the door
 but others can get crazy drunk
not sure why
 and there is leave me the eff alone
 ticking something off my really long bucket list
 really when i don't have to go to uni i don't go anywhere at all
i am shaky and afraid
 people have tried
so my dad rang me today i screened the call
 please dont give up
 called down
 no longer as simply the whimperings of my poor depressed soul
 everything looks/feels empty and futile
 i just want to enjoy life and those that are in it instead of dreading every moment of it and being scare of death to begin with
 still get picked on from time to time
 if someone is coming to visit and i have to give my tiny flat a good clean that takes a week
 i have basically come to terms with being 'that kind of stupid'
  it still hurts even now
 i went out last night to a pub for a drink
 when it happens again
i feel like garbage
but yet i still ride this horrible ride
i'm only pretty to desperate or drunk people
 since i was very young i've had this big dream to have children
 after i found out she blocked me i did the same for a few hours
 or just didn't want to get this on paper (or whatever you call putting it on a website/forum)
 on top of it all he made me work on a site where i had to talk to horny men with all sorts of weird ideas in their heads and entertain them for money
 oh god
 but this doesn't make me get to know people at all
 he's the complete opposite of the idiot
 i know there's no answers
 i don't need friends though
 this day may not be special to anyone else
 however
i have a scoliosis and only got the diagnosis a couple of years ago (because no doctor was allowed to examine me when i was a kid and a young teen
  she also told me that counsellors can sort of put false memories into people's brains
we stopped talking after that for a while until my counselor at the residential treatment program encouraged me to forgive her
 doesn't ask whats wrong
 most days i wouldn't even call myself a ‰ÛÏgood person‰Û
 i had a really nice ear doctor as a kid
 meaning i was forced to use the stairs
  i find it hard not to be upset at that
 my heart racing
so i need advice on how to be assertive with my needs
 but to shun and spread hate towards skinny girls in the process is disgusting to me
 i feel alright most of the time
 a worthless piece of shit
i know it all my fault for letting myself get walked all over and not being able to say no
 at the same time as i have my next appointment with my therapist
 my md tells me that gp (gross profit) is the same as margin
 i guess my eyes weren't awake yet
 and i am afraid they would be right
  will let more out later
i provided this pos reference with the reasons why i'm choosing this new opportunity
 ive been clean for months now
 this anger is seeping into everything
 i even cried as i fell asleep last night
  she was the new kid nobody knew and i was the weird kid nobody liked
 my aunt sent a text saying the guy had faked it all
 go home'
" um
i don't remember how long after that the next part happened
  been forcing myself to eat for the baby and already i feel huge
the insecurities are the worst though
just "whatever" right now
 she is going through a lot right now anyways
 aware how badly they were treated and how they do not exist in official statistics
 people in the department do not like her and i have been sticking up for her
 tired of myself for being so weak
 although i wouldn't be opposed to the occasional table game when on vacation or something
 and i had to use a lot of mental strength to just wash them
 and i can't talk to my family about it
"why didn't you tell anyone
 i told my references to expect a call
 i'm alone anyway and have no family except my dog
 i want to actually smile again and mean it
 i'm just beyond frustrated
i finally talked to my spouse yesterday
 i'm just ashamed that i let myself go like this
 i don't want this anymore
 i would starve myself
  future worry but i know how i get when there are gaps in therapy
 and dealing with people looking weird at me when i take elevators just because i don't look sick
  i'm not sure what made me think that
 i was really nervous
i went home
 so i was off of them for 6 days
  i found out she'd lied too
 i should be organizing my lecture notes
 he just laughed at me
  but now i can kind of laugh about how hard she must be trying
 i had people i could speak to
 or at least not hit me
 but i can't
 my brain is really hurting
 lonliness
 i won't ever do that again
 he started playing a game like being silly and hiding behind signs and stuff and then running past me
 only for her to bring it up once again
one of the last words she said to me while we were still a couple was "why did you have to ruin a perfectly good thing
 i bought an 8gb stick of ram and am hoping that fixes the problem
 she could have just talked to me rather than ignore me for the last few weeks
  we worked it out in the end
 that i was not getting better and should allow others to care for me for a little while
 i even cried and screamed a bit
 2 pots 3 pots coffee doesnt matter
school is almost over(in 2 weeks) i dont think i can call for an incomplete and i am spending all of my energy just trying to just stay alive
 even if they just are using me for help now
but i got out
i'm twenty-two years old now
miserable
i'm paranoid as hell about it all but im doing it
i have $10 in free play at the casino so i plan to go down there and run through it and whatever i have the end cash out
 afterwards
  because i really need to laugh about this
 no im not in any immediate danger but i wish i was
 i know)
 i would likely do it
 i got up though and got slightly productive
 i want those days where yeah
 i know i just want to be at home but i can't because i'm babysitting and will be for tonight and the next two nights while my friend and her partner at work
 there's nothing outside to be afraid of (except a public panic attack) i'm tired of no motivation
of course my back and hip wouldn't allow that ro happen
 i say no and people won't respect it
 i don't want to die really
i fail to understand why my landlord thinks it's funny when he's had multiple complaints about bats getting into this apartment
 on everything she could possibly use to contact me
 yet i don't want to do it
 i thought today would be a bad day
 i don't want this
 if possible and focus on laundry
 when its the last thing i am thinking of when i go to bed and the first thing i think of when i wake up
 i eat all the time
 but it wouldn't matter if she didn't
  so now she posts a ton of photos of her doing yoga on her horse
 the sound it makes when this happens is like none i've ever heard
 i had written myself a promise that i would not make it to my sixteenth birthday and even though i tried many times
"stop
 other times
 but the earth's axis does not get demoralised or suffer burn out or need to eat
 and i haven't seen this friend anywhere
 the one person i thought i could trust the most
 and when i do
  she broke me down
 my name is kaitlin and i am surivivor
 i am haunted by the dead and the stories they told
 i'm insecure about my personality: i feel like i'm annoying and sometimes off-standish
"don't play your games with me kid
 and it feels like its getting worse
 right now my mouth is full of sores which are very painful
 even though it's just another shitty day
 i can't tell audrey about how i feel
 goddamnit
 another thing i am wondering
 then told them that i can't have anyone else knowing
 it comes back
  i can only remember bad ones
so while i don't actively seek out any methods
i hate their sexism homophobia ableism ageism racism
 or at least struggle with it
 not what other people expect of me
some of you know i am having a really hard time feeling like facebook friends don't care about me at all
 i'll exercise for a few days but then lose motivation
just venting - 
 whenever i try to explain this to people
 and one of them has digestive problems
 i wish i could
 and so ill
 things are so bad at work i forget what i've done a few seconds after i've done it
when i got home i just started crying and just started talking and cuddling with my rabbits and cried
 this regret has flowed through me like poison
 pathetic really) show you a picture of me killing a puppy or something
  we didn't spend a lot of time talking
 i am just a thin girl in general
 people like me don't want to be persuaded to live we just want help in ending it as it's so painful to live this life
 i'm tired alright
 i'm still just a disgusting twig in their eyes
 why would you fake your own death just to get attention
 tuesday i can clean the loo
 i test people that i know
 my friend has a job now and don't get me wrong i am so glad that she does
 i don't even know what to do with my life
i just hate the life i have and i wish i could take it away without failing
 i'm just over a week free of self harm myself and i will celebrate every single second of that
  i'm trying to get better and i am
 because my birthday is on monday and i wanted a night out
 which i feel like is a different sort of tired
 i think about the same bad events that happened in the past and worry if similar things will happen in the future
i won't though
 today i am almost deaf on one ear and partially deaf on the other
 but in the end
 it was one or two months ago and i was so depressed i wasnt even able to wash my face
i am exhausted
 i imagine things beyonds these walls
 so yeah"
i feel like i have always been taking care of them
 but i have no idea what you're talking about
so i feel like medication isnt the only cause of my problem but it makes my mood very worse
 it hurt more than anyone could think
 i want to go drive as fast as i can in the mountains
 i have ad/hd and focus is hard to come by as it is but the inability was novel
 they give me meds for my physical condition which has no effect and i have not got out of my flat in over a decade
 and the doctor added that it wasn't supposed to hurt
 this is the twenty-first century and she can do as she pleases
 i've accomplished nothing in my life and i haven't been happy in at least 10 years
 i'm also sick
it's like my entire world has been turned upside down
i keep having these repetitive negative thoughts that are making me depressed
  she also told me that she would have never left me alone so this can't have happened
 that time of the month always feels a little extra weird for me
 it has been so hard not knowing what to do or say to him
 i feel like i need to kowtow to everyone's demands
 i have nothing
 headache and what i thought was food poisoning
 which is nothing
 possibly pick up a breakfast sandwich or something on the way home
 the only time i feel better is when i reach a state of numbness
 they sent me home with shots to give myself
 and what was i met by
 why do i have this weird duty to live
 i hate myself for that
 do skinny girls not have feelings
 but can you tell me what's up
 i couldn't imagine hurting anyone like that
after all this time
 it even looked like she had a hint of disgust in her eyes
 the past month has honestly been hell for me and i've relapsed with self harm multiple times
 cos after all the only reason i want to get out is because i'm in intense pain
 he'd probably already reached home at this point
 but still nothing came up
 i don't know why people think it is okay to bully me
 so he wasn't that much of a worry intelectually
 turned up the music in my headphones and stared out the window
 un-exaggeratingly apathetic
  trying not to give back into behaviors but just so hard when i feel this way
 why was i such an idiot
 and it took me about two week to build up the courage and say i could only do a max of 3 night's a week
  i feel like maybe we could grow apart and i don't want that to happen
  well i don't like it
i only seen him two days and not even  whole days but now i cant visit those places without thinking of him
 and referred to my friends as "assholes" even though she knows none of them
i now have a stupid desire to eat more junk food and to actually gain weight in a massively unhealthy way just so i can get those judgemental eyes off me
"it just sunk in"
 how low can you get emotionally
 am i borderline personality disorder
 i hate life
[so i decided to make this diary because i wasn't sure where to talk about all the little things i feel and minor things that happen without spamming threads
 but i'm waiting for a reply and i am just imagining all of their emotions as they read it
 unable to change focus from all of the pending threats in my life
 i guess i got more negative towards the end
 i'm  20 now and due to rumors about me at my previous college i had to take a semester off and have really cut communication with everyone because of my worsening anxiety and trust
 but i am left now feeling achey and tired all the time
 rather i came back because i am actually doing good for sometime now and just wanted to reread how badly i was doing before and the feeling of doing okay now is something precious to me
 because i don't want to upset the apple cart
 and if i wince in pain or stretch she gets worried
 the cats are not allowed in there
 every single one of them did the exact same thing
 i could go and get henry out and she would go herself with the cans
 not relapse into drugs
 i was about to cry from pain at that point
 she goes through it too so she has herself to worry about
  i confirmed nothing and denied suicide plans
i can't even let it out i'm over repeating myself
i just feel so awful
and lastly the feeling very lost part
 this is why it doesn't pay to talk
 i don't understand myself
 i can't even explain how i feel right now
 and she said she wasn't sorry
i just want to scream
i've found out my great aunts don't like me because i'm not fully black and don't even "act" black
 i hate this
it's a struggle to do anything and i don't even see the point
 that snore
 in my case it's mainly physical pain and feeling trapped that makes me want to die
 and so maybe it needs more ram; but just for the hell of it
 it's all coming back to me  i want to find a comfy rock and hide under it
  i still struggle with the thoughts
 i've been just pretending to go
 after all
 impossible
 cold
 i don't know what
 since
 that i classified as "friends"
i'm new to the whole thought of actually opening up about myself and being 100% honest
lost a few friends once again and feel others pulling away
 but know i cannot help but come off as needy
 i just know i'm going to end up alone again
different ways have been going through my head all day
 he informed me that a friend of my cousin killed himself recently
 i am currently in therapy with a therapist i trust and i am waiting on dbt to start
 ritalin and concerta here
 i try to tell people this hurts me
  i always had it in my head that he came with this grand toy and took me  kidnapped me because
 was released from the hospital about ten hrs ago
 when i look at the problems "normal " people have i'm envious
 do the dishes
 out of adherence to an abstract social pronouncement
 depressed
 he did but just as i was about to click the leash on him he ran again
 i still can't talk to people
 i'm not good enough
i decided i didn't want to do that
 i'm tired of feeling this way
)  if something big comes up or i start feeling severely suicidal
 and i'm sad all the time
 i should be learning more for my exams
 i guess
today i took a shortcut home from the store that lead me through the train station
 i usually piss through it
i haven't been on this site in a while now
 i want to numb myself and shut down and hide forever
 but sometimes you have to certain things
 on friday
 don't plan on it either
 it lasts the entire day
 i hope
  but she sure took pictures
 so depressed
grrrrrrr
 i'm getting to the point of wondering if anyone even sees me as a human being any more
 i have me
 of course not
 maybe for awhile which is the main cause
35 = å£100
again sorry if this is the wrong forum i just needed to get that out
i go to bed angry and wake up angry
 and she told me she felt like i wasnt treating her like a friend like she was inconviniencing me
i try everything that i can to get the girl
 and they would still assume that my skinny frame was to do with some kind of mental illness like bulimia
  failing 8 and 9
 i'm rambling
 and i was still tired
 does anyone relate to this
i haven't been on here for a few years
 but dear god
 and why now
 friends
 i have tried to get help
 currently i am under 340‰Û_i think
 i was actually looking forward to it
 but the same feelings are there to torment me
 i'm tied of everything about life
 in the first one i dropped out after only 2 months
 i just want to get everything off my chest since i can't open up to my family or friends
 she says i'm not allowed to discuss my feelings with anyone
i am always scared of saying what i need or thing for fears that nobody will like me
 that i could make it down the stairs
 i know there is a diary section on this forum but i wanted people who felt the need to give feedback to be able to do so
 i've been insecure all my life
 i've been a burden
 not that any of you probably care
she asks me if i am a rape victim or not just because i dont want her to touch my ass
 "can you tell me what's on the screen when this happens
 but i guess thats how its supposed to be
it's all just to pass time
 he doesn't like touch
 they were eating
 this would be known as ‰ÛÏtilting‰Û
 and this paradox is the only one that exists
i'm the lonley girl in the corner
realized that i forgot to take my meds yesterday
 i guess i mentioned it a couple times already but i really don't see a nice feature anymore
 what happens if the landlord refuses to do anything
 i am a person now
  i mean
 can i see a different doctor then please
next issue
 why on earth would she
i don't have anyone to talk to about it
 to feel that feeling
 i bet everyone didn't care about the fact i couldn't give a fact but it stayed in my mind and i kept thinking that they were all staring at me and judging me
 i know what's going on
 i've taken my meds and still cannot calm the hell down
 and i am sure i told her i wasnt sure i could physically walk around all day
 and i never want to turn into her
 10 methods to die'
 i have barely been able to keep my eyes open
i'm feeling down and kinda want to hurt myself
 i'm scared to walk the halls without being pushed over or insulted
 i try to lose weight and i just fail at it
 i don't know him very well at all
  (even though i know it's not really her fault
 some of my friends didn't like him but i wanted to be nice and i had nothing against him so i let him sit with us
 i'm feeling very sorry for myself tonight and feel like i want to cry
 a pain in the ass to everyone here and i admit it
 just saying
 but i can choose to let go a more 'normal'/'right' way but just pulling my sh*t together
  i just don't think i'm cut out for a job
i know that i will hate myself after this
i'm having a really bad day
  facing minimum 90 days in jail (likely 6 months)
 i've spent most of the time trying to fix myself and others
once the anxiety raises then all else spirals
 guess because the thread said "let it all out" so i'm trying
 but with my depression i just don't seem to have the time to just ‰ÛÏtrophy hunt‰Û like i used to
 i know i would be after the weekend
  been struggling with eating without feeling so sick
 but the instructor was a physiotherapist and she assessed me one day when i showed up at the class in bad pains
 she was in too much pain that i could not justify keeping her in this world any longer
 depressed and suicidal
 so scared of falling because of my screwed balance
i don't know if this will trigger anyone
 if i'm sad
today she touched my ass again and it just made me really grossed out
 where he would easily be found
30/11 during the week night but later friday's as he is a chef
 but for the most part i'm emotionally dead
 i got put next to 3 other girls who i didn't talk to really
  it's like they don't feel they exist fully if they aren't documenting every moment
 nothing helped
 i am 26 and i have those irrational fears sometimes still
 so why waste a scan on me
 i came for my back
 my guess is that something is bogging down the memory
i've been having an extremely tough time lately
 i worry myself
 she told me i did indeed have a slipping disc in my spine
in a way i think my period might be a trigger too
so i went to bed 'early' (meaning midnight) because i have a therapy session today and wanted to have some sleep behind me to help me be more robust
 just doesn't make sense any more
 i get slapped in the face
 in my case
i'm stressed
my life has been grasping for courage for hope for fortune
 just had enough of it all
 they won't love or befriend me
 and she couldn't even take out a single bag of garbage
 if you see someone sad everytime
 it was even worse when one came through the light fixture above the shower
 who cut me out of his life without empathy or explanation
 i don't want to burden the few loved ones i have
  i've been dead for so long
 she realised what she was doing wasn't the way to go about things (not a serious case
 that get carried away
 i hate their strong efforts to make people who arent like them second class person
most of all i hope that you never get let down again
 hell i'm not doing so great right now
thats it im so fucking done with it
now i just feel used
 then laugh at them with contempt and scorn when they come to me for help
 it's bad enough to deal with these demons on my own
i am not supposed to be okay today
 i'm done
 i have it when they stare at me in places
 but at least once a week fantasize how wonderful it would be if my doctor told me i have a terminal illness from which i would die within a month
 they say i'm just lazy and a liar and all this stuff
 people on some forums suggested me i should be looking into clubs and all
  i see therapists
 i feel disgusting
 i know she recognized my voice
 but looking at how far i have come in just a year i know i can do this
 in reality i may simply be suffering from depression
 what is that
 if i fail or not
 i have my fingers crossed that doesn't happen
 believe me
i just wanna have a fucking relationship with them
i'm sorry for venting so much
 obviously since that can't happen i just have to deal with it
 the place looked like a trash heap when i got back there
 i'm not at home but i will weigh myself and update it
  i texted my friend about it 
  one of the two i've been torturing with talk of suicidal thoughts recently
 i know he doesn't love me
 but i'm tired of life
 but it's nothing more than fatigue
 i'm so tired of this depression and anxiety
 i can assure you
and don't get me wrong i know some of those activities bring success enjoyment at fun and some don't
my blood-sugar was running high all night (i have type 1 diabetes)
 i could tell her anything and everything going on and so much of me wants to scream to her that i am still here today after all of this and revel in my accomplishment
 with me starting therapy and opening up so many bottled things and so much abuse; the last thing i need is to fulfill others expectations
 i have no motivation
 am i just a target of everyone just telling me off that i don't know about
 run
my feelings are constantly broken when it comes to a girl things
i was one again avoiding by changing my aunts subjects
 i am tempted to when i feel better and see what it takes to get into an acting school as well
 i hear
 i'm apparently just not allowed to have anything that makes me happy
i used to go crazy and hit her like i am a kung fu master
 chatting away
which leads me to my other former/ lost friend
a totally useless human
 but i think the sunrise might have woken me
  my heart is going to stop and my brain is going to explode
  i have been as far as having plan and date time to complete it
  now i feel a little guilty about the disbelief somehow
 but i'm hoping that i can also find some reassurance and hope
 and normally when i say stupid i am talking about some emotionally driven decision or action - and i am that kind of stupid on an almost perpetual basis
  just whatever
 i hit a fucking wall
  i'm just "whatever" i had enough
 wish these feelings and thoughts would end
 in case anyone is worrying i'm not actively suicidal because i still have some kind of irrational hope
i am just having some weird thoughts on top of it
 she'd seemed fine no more than 5 minutes ago
i can't say anything
  in my case
 i have no other choice left
i have depression and anxiety and it sucks
 but not because i was feeling down again or that im thinking of killing myself or something
 most wouldn't understand anyway
but suddenly the dog ran away from me
 i can't run because of my spine and hip and tried to command him to stop
 nothing seem to have much meaning for me 
 the doctor who saw me at the psych er a couple of weeks ago said i probably had the flu after checking my vitals and for a few days i did try to take care of that
 just low on energy and things in this house isn't going well
 i just couldn't stand up for myself
 silence all night
 i didn't say much back
 it scares the shit out of me and causes me to not want to leave my house sometime
  this person has not just facebook going
 i wanna go back in time and scream at my past self for what i did
 i may not have anyone in my life right now that knows everything that happened
maybe
 a cop-out
 i'm just tired and weary
 i spend my days talking to my ldr boyfriend
 i even threw up before sessions
 i can concentrate
i can't even cry
 life is full of disappointment and empty gestures
 i always feel like i'm going to make a mistake or make the wrong decision
 i've never been to see a professional about the way i behave
 my hip hurts too
 probably won't be much but i like to play the $1
 going for a walk
 i had hoped at least she could take a message or something
 because until now she was never the sort of person to bring another person down for something as superficial as looks
my neighbor asked if i wanted to return cans with her and go can hunting
 but i don't
cold
 there was no notes anywhere saying it was out of order
 and i feel like i can get things done
 he talked me into coming home but i refused so many times because i just felt like saying goodbye to everything right then and there
 though she said they're just friends
 i don't know
i meant to start this sooner but i just didn't make time for it
 so i try to stay off of here as much as possible now
i feel like i am caught in this cycle of severe depression/anxiety climbing up to "okay" or even "good"
 or so and so pissing her off
 i feel like no one takes me seriously
 no one really asks either
 no-one said a word but i caught one of my friends staring as i quickly put on my pe jacket to cover them up
 i guess i would feel guilty if something bad happened to them
 i've been called a shithead
 i walked after him
having someone that close to me  pick at my flaws really has made me feel even more naked and exposed to everything and everyone
 even if i do not have a job
 the toy doesn't exist 
 i kept getting more and more pills
 over six weeks
 being big doesn't help the pain
 not run away
 these could get to become novels
 it started a few weeks ago with the flu that developed into sinusitis and tonsillitis and i ended up on antibiotics and steroids
 but i'm just tired of the darkness that seems to surround me
 so why does this behavior continue to happen towards me
 just going to try to rest
i'm tired
 but how will they know when he is really in trouble if he cries wolf like that
 i've gotten to the point where i don't cry anymore
 i'm sick
 so maybe try my hand at interior decorating
 but it also made me angry that he would do that
 but it's a fact that in soon a year i only got to know around 5-10 people at uni and i don't really consider any of them to be a really close friend
i genuinely feel like there is something wrong
 from extreme to "moderate" wishes
 i know i could go to the library
yeah
 i started the call off by explaining that i'd probably only be able to provide limited information because i'm totally blind
  i was terrified at the thought
 sharp smoke enters my skull and i just feel like banging my head hard against a wall to make it stop or even better just chop it off
 but she gets offended
 she hardly has time to talk to me
 he's my only friend and honestly
 because i knew that there would always be people in this world who would be judgemental and ignorant
 but i am willing to try anything at this point
 asked her if she was mad at me or something and just not returning messages or what
 whatever
 this is goimg to be a weird thread maybe but i want to let it all out
 and nasal congestion
 nothing more
 i know nothing that happened to me is my fault
 but i do so much
i know most of what i'm thinking is irrational but it dosnt mean i can stop the thoughts no matter how much i tell myself that it still dosnt stop it
 i'm not smart enough
 i can't talk to shannon
 none of what i said was hateful
 he pushed me away and stated as he likes to that he's not going anywhere
so yeah
 during one session mum managed to drag me to i was covering my ears and screamed "don't touch me
 i'm alive
 going crazy
 clean the house
 with an instructor who was not an actual psychologist or therapist
 i'm very bitter about my situation and just want to not be here
 see potentially abusive partners everywhere (b) i don't even really know what i want in a relationship as said it probably would be just stupid right now (c) i'm absolutely boring
 since he had supposedly done it in a public place
i just need to vent about this
 i hate starting conversations and they always made me start
 ive mentioned it to my therapist
 or me annoying her
)  plus there's at least one other person she calls her "best friend"
 what else have i been ignoring
went to the hospital for pain my back
 and i have been having paranoia
 it usually starts off in my mind as failing a class
 why on earth would she feel it is okay to do this
is to be emotionally neutral
 or weren't strong enough
 even though it was all jokes it hurt me and i just wanted to be left alone
 i also explained that their website is no longer accessible with a screen reader
i'm so upset
 none of it was about me 
i want to help my friend out because i am that kind of person
 i'm afraid that one day i can't stand it anymore
 i wouldn't mind dating someone as boring as me but what are you supposed to talk with a person like that
 i invite that on myself for being unhappy
 why do i feel like i want to stay in this cycle
 it hurts
 i can have conversations with people about uni related stuff for hours
 or that i need to eat more in order to look "normal"
i tried to have a bath because i don't have one at home but all i could do was stress
 i didnt want to create this thread but now i feel like i have to
 the last time it happened was midnight a few days ago
 i am so afraid of losing him
 which caused me to have hives
who cries endless silent tears
 loss of appetite
 my legs looked massive
a long while after i tried physiopilates because someone online had said that it helped with her scoliosis pain
 this was simply a teenage drama
 monotony
 every
 i feel so sad and angry all at the same time
 it has affected my bladder function
 why can i not get my shit together
 when suddenly something hits me in the side
 exercise just feels like drudgery--go figure
 i hate being desperate yet it's all i feel i am
  i don't know how often i'll write here
  i couldn't endure it
by the time i realized i was in the wrong and tried to make amends
 except for my counselor every 2 weeks
  maybe i should attempt the pointless experiment of at least speaking out loud
i mean
 but no she will talk to him
 under one of the sessions with the ear doctor when i was around 10 he drained my ears with a very noisy apparatus and by accident ruptured my eardrum
 i'm really insecure about my looks and feel like i'm ugly and horrible and that no-one actually likes me
i know i have looked after this girl quiet a few times without her mum or dad around
i've had a not very nice tooth ache most of the day
 my friends say i can talk to them but i'm scared to because i feel like i'm bothering them
 i'm scared to put my hand up in lessons for fear of being wrong and being made fun of
 the only person i know with this was my mother
 i sat myself down on the side of the road
 she told me multiple times that i need time for myself
 i messaged her mother on facebook to help her because i knew i couldn't
 i bet you never heard of a poodle-horse before
 very short conversation there that ended in me stating that he doesn't like to be touched and he said "sorry"
 but as usual i stood by myself
  triggers come unexpectedly and without me knowing what or why
 way too go but my eating habits are getting under control
 i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up
 my uncle tried looking up the story online and couldn't find anything
 self exile any better
i work in academia
i don't know what tomorrow holds for me
my anxiety is so bad i feel reckless
 despite the fact i did also suffer from an eating disorder in my teen years
 i don't like bars
  i play poker a lot and sometimes i just make really bad decisions
 in fact
why do anything in our life's
 i don't understand
 they would probably think my irrational fears are laughable too
 in all this i don't have any time for myself at all and the crazy thing is that if for once i have time for myself i don't know what do anymore
 the thing for me is that being well isn't not thinking about suicide
people say i want to be depressed
 that's how i feel
 to stop it
 since all my eating disorders make it difficult to lose weight that way (and lets face it
i'm just so tied of feeling so miserable
  am valued by no one
 that's what the flu always does to me
i'm self deprecating
except more and more pain
 i then got a text shortly afterwards that my constant texting and trying to call her was making her uncomfortable and she wanted me to leave her alone
 it was too late
pffft
 outmaneuvered me consistently
 late at night
 i dont want to wake up but i cant kill myself
 i am always scared i'll meet someone who used to bully me
ever since birth
so i woke up at 6 am
 not looking for more
  i'm not laughing at her
 and eventually commiting suicide
 well almost never
 i am pathetic and don't even stand up to my own core principles
  i would like to start playing video games again
 that was two weeks ago
in my mind if one cannot positively and significantly effect a number of lives that sums up to a number greater than they would hurt if they were dead is a waste of resources
 i want to let go
i work overnights so i will probably head home to sleep right after the free play
 i wish i were normal
and then i listen to how they are because they don't know any better anymore and i'm not about to tell them i'm on the verge of suicide
 i honestly don't even know why i'm on this site
 "youre losing him
 she keeps being out all day avoiding being home
 damn
i'm tied
 i am supposed to fill my life with things i like to do
alone in this prison i peer
 but today i feel so down i'm not sure what to think of it
  she also doesn't know that i sh or have suicidal thoughts
 but what tops it off is when i am sitting on my bed
i wanted to give medication time to see if this effect would go
 and no man has control of me
 but first of all there aren't even that many at my uni and second as said i don't even really know what i want to do anymore
 however my doctor told me when i was 20 that i might not be able to conceive
 but instagram
  i started getting suicidal thoughts again
 i can't
 i'm unable to forgive my younger brother
 and even that hurts
 when i first joined sf i was barely 15 and hanging on by a thread
 i just want it to go away
also i was very depressed when i first started my therapy for adhd
 and i'm pretty sure my dad would be too
 i'm not really sure how to start this so i guess i should explain what this is and why i am doing it
i saw a doctor
  i've withered into nothing
 cause my brain dosnt seem to want to help with regulating feelings and emotions
we have only strattera
 my ptsd symptoms literally disappear
 i'm doing fairly well 
i came back again
 no pets
 i gulped
 i want to stay and look after my dog
 but freaked me out beyond belief
 and i exercise regularly
  i'm not special in any way
 depressed and anxious and that was what kept me so exhausted
 most people just hate going back because of learning
 i at least fantasize about the joy i would feel if i ever get a terminal-type diagnosis from my doctor
 i just really needed to vent before i cry at my desk
  i haven't tried in years
 i've tried medication
 he acts cold now when i'm feeling sad
 carly will go on a trail ride if i make her
before i started i said i could do a max of 3 night's a week
i have been so tired
 i have
 they don't think i can do anything right
 he kidnapped me and quickly got caught which lead to several events and 2 yrs later he took his life 
there is
 i wasn't built to handle life
 and while i understand what i think the reason was
 and my emotions are just like a yoyo and i can't control it
 my doctors doesn't seem to worry about that
 but everyone laughs and claps when a skinny girl gets the hate
 i always end up here
 i don't really know how to cope
 but they either stopped working
 i don't wanna harm myself because that's just gonna hurt more
 everything feel so meaning less
 but the thought of trying to leave the house to meet so many disappointing mismatched therapists until i find one i can trust and respect seems impossible
 i just dont want to feel this way anymore
  may have to call my dr in the morning and schedule an appointment
 and so i get anxiety in any social situation
 it will probably just be painful to look back and realize that i mostly wasted these years too
yes its scary stuff
i'm finally putting inheritance money to use and going on holiday by myself (well on a group tour thing)
 i can't blame them
 as i am homeless and really
 my mom touches me in a weird way since i was a teenager
 just in case someone was wondering
since i have no one
 the thing is i won't be busy i had to stop uni until next semester so i can't use i'll be busy with that
)  that was when things changed
 but he just keeps making passes at me
 i could barely walk
 but without the obsessiveness
 but for some reason
  my hopes
 i called
 bitter
 don't really plan on doing anything anytime soon
today i saw my horse
 either i am depressed one day or angry the next
tonight i feel i'm at my ends
 and suddenly i just felt completely okay
 she noticed i was off and asked what was wrong so i just told her i thought (and i did) she meant just returning them
 and before i knew it they had left
 they're a last resort
 and suddenly i realized i was having a really
 they also talked about other conditions etc and i told her i had un-diagnosed ptsd which also kept me inside a lot
 hoping that some driven enough and foolish enough lifts me from my willful trek towards hopelessness
 for at least 4 days the elevator has been out of service
 so what's the point
 then it seems like it's perfectly acceptable to throw insults around
 this is my second attempt at college
one the other side of the world
 it causes me a lot of pain and i'm so
 her partner is at least a 20min train ride away plus walking to and from his work or to the house
 but i feel like i am crazy
 the other actively recruited me for this position
 from having to battle to get up in the morning
 she just touches my ass and leave her arm there
 i know they aren't officially connected to the station (they just have their shop in the station building and sell tickets
 i'm trying so hard to lose weight
 my mom went along with me all these years talking about this dumb thing 
i spoke to my therapist
 i'll survive
 made me feel crappy
 i'm suicidal
and times like this
 and last night i spent hours curled up crying
 i didn't want to wait 2 hours for the insulin to completely take effect because fuck that
 i'm a fucken puppet
 you'll get tired of it
i don't even want to do anything anymore i just want to curl up and rott away in my unit
"i hate you"
my goal is to spend an hour writing every day for this
i try n think of things to do and then i get about a million different reasons as to why it's pointless and shouldn't do it
 lost job
today i got up and i skipped breakfast and spent my time in the bathroom putting as many different types of spot cream and dirt cleansers as i could as i have a lot of acne
 the second time i blacked out
 and even before i got her she didn't get saddled up very often for many years
' born of political spin and equally as empty
 strike one
it just undid what i tried to do
 about 15 minutes later these boys came up to us and started bullying him (like they usually do)
 needless to say
 after that i felt actual dread having to go there
i can't remember things anymore
 i'm so afraid i'll lose him
 33yrs ago so not like this just happened but 
 the scarring on my eardrums have messed up the pressure inside my ears
so how do you go about being more assertive so that what you say is actually heard and taken seriously
i'm unable to forgive my dysfunctional upbringing
 but there's no toy 
 by train
 i basically sit in the background watching everyone else progress
 but she's made me feel more lost than usual and i have only here to turn to for advice
 it bothers me also that any choice or opinion i have that doesn't match his will continue in the same question over and over until i agree
i am sorry i hurt you
 but i only read the return part
 medication
 no matter how hard i tried
 i can't go to any of my friends and burden them with this
who is hanging by a thread
 they cycle through doctors and medication and i cannot relate because there do not seem to be any real events they can list as long and terrible as mine
 i got really angry and yelled at her always
 she had a whole questionnaire and went through it with me
 it was bad enough when one was flying through the kitchen one night
 even my dog is depressed
 everything and i mean everything is just passing time until the end comes
 her reaction was to panic and get a therapist who considered putting me on a hold (i kept most details private)
 and i can't endure this
 no matter how much i wanted to
 she stops a lot
 please help
  then i told her that i went to a school counsellor and that memories started coming back
 and if you were skinny then you weren't a "real girl"
 i haven't drunk anything in a few days
i am so sick of this
i feel myself in post trauma
 i wasn't about to be a victim
 and i will get depressed again
 but he's fully aware that i'm gay and not into men
 he recently told me that he wasn't sure if he want to be with me
  things were a little rocky at first
 luckily he was wearing a brace so he was easy to grab and was just wagging his tail
but he just sent me a text
 i am afraid that one will bite me when i am sleeping or something
today is april 18
 but they do know that i do have problems with anxiety and being categorized as anything
 "i'm visually impaired
 what am i doing
it feels like an eternity
  i would like to curb my‰Û_other gambling habits
 i'm really fed up with it
 i end up in a bad place emotionally
my doctor referred me to a center that was supposed to have some group sessions for people with chronic pains who needed to learn how to deal with it and settle with that life
 spending most days indoors and a lot of the time in bed i guess i don't notice
 and all of a sudden it felt like a huge hole punched in my gut and i i started sobbing and felt really really bad
 so i apologize in advance if it does
i did a lot of things to navigate through the day
 telling me when does she ever not drink her drinks
 i look for advice
 a job i hate that expires in june and no prospects of getting another job
 lied down and brooded for about an hour
or sometimes in the evening
 to me at least
 and just because i haven't gained the weight that people expect me to
 one reason i haven't done it yet is because it would hurt those who care about me
 sneezing
 i'm not about to tell them i have planned this out again
 fatally overdosed
  my parents asked me a few things
 it's not all the time anymore
 i hate easter 
 i feel everyone hates me although they are just thoughts i know
 i wanted to run out of there and cry but i said no i am going to stay and do what i have to do reminding myself that my weight is not permanent
 for various reasons
 other days i sit here and wallow in the fact that i am still alive
 i had to hide in the bathroom where it was now light
 i think it was 2005
 and i can circle the charges i wish to dispute and mail it back
 i should also be solving more exercises to actually hand in some every now and then (i'm so glad this is not required at my school
 i know a few things about anatomy and i was thinking i had a slipping disc or one being squeezed by my twisting spine
 i demanded reasons
 im sick of it all
so i made 40 fake facebook accounts
 that made me worse
 tired of looking for answers that lead to disappointment
while this has angered me for many years
 instead of having to force myself to get out of bed in the morning
 it shouldn't hurt
compared to the weekend this is nothing i suppose
i don't come on sf anymore until i get really down
 i have yet to do what i would call a serious attempt
 everything is my fault
 any suggestions
a bad day is like today
 each day seems worse than before with the occasional short(hours) reprieve
 i can't imagine how many times i have told her to drop and forget about something from the past
 yeah
 my eyes don't fucking work
 my feelings have been rather low-key of late
  my parents told me the next morning that it had been my best friend's mom saying that my best friend had told her i was planning something drastic
 i now ended up crushing on an anime character
 pulling/messing with my hair and saying things to me
 no one knows about the real me
 not even for work
 and i guess sunshine is healthy for you
  it's sent now so no going back
sooner or later
 considering the things i mentioned about my parents
 i might gain a pound
 she thinks that i am being influenced by "bad" people
so drained lately
sorry sir
 and i have been my whole life
 and it's very hard to exercise with this condition
 i know i shouldn't be a horrible daughter but i can't help it
 but to me
 my head gets so quiet
 and i haven't eaten anything for nearly two days
 i lock myself in the bathroom
 it makes me think of an addict in recovery who isn't using maybe
 you always here people say i don't care what people say when really they do and hide it but i really don't and honestly i know it's a bad thing
 it was just awkward
other words in my dictionary
 i am the peace maker and basically i make sure they don't kill one another
 but for how long
  i haven't really bought anything for it in the 13 months i have been here
 i would like to start saving it for something
it's now been a week
 never know what to say and definitely don't know what's going on in my head
 it sucks
 im barely ever content
 who was behind me
 don't really think i'll work at such a place
i am so worthless and not worth anything
 this song causes me to cry uncontrollably
 i really do hope i can bring myself to post regularly now that i have found actual freedom to do so
 if i didn't take out the trash
 cook or clean and for not having a boyfriend or even looking for one
 but nope
 i hate myself more than anyone ever could
 awkward silence because both people are boring as death
 i'm told i'm not unhappy because of  physical or emotional abuse nor my social awkwardness; and besides
 it's mild to moderate 99% of the time
i am panicked if somthing happens to her daughter as i don't have my licence so i dont drive or even have a car so in an emergency i can't really get anywhere fast
 he says he loves me but it seems like all he can do is focus on the negitive things about our relationship
 and i spoke to every single one trying to get this "information" out of them
 i don't wanna kill myself anymore because what's the point
 they didn't keep me this time
 the list goes on and on
 i felt sad for my cousin
i can't even get out all that's going through my head its just going so fast right now
 i still don't take chances
 i know it takes work to get well
 or even what i assume that they expect
so i reported my counsellor to his supervisor because he made me feel like i was deserving and responsible for the verbal child abuse that i told him about
 cold turkey
 livestreams and youtube videos
well i have 15 minutes so i guess i can talk about the battle plan for the day
i feel so pathetic as a human i have done nothing useful for anybody or for myself
 nobody will miss me
restless night of thunderstorms and rain
 i am in remission from my eating disorder and have been for almost a decade
 and after all of this to finally fall asleep just to have nightmares
i went to the kiosk
 i start throwing things at it
 and have a bad hearing on the other
 he hadn't noticed the dog
my sick back is acting up
 i have that creepy crawly feeling
for once i hadn't set my alarm
tired of waking up with the darkness of depression
 but today
 one was assigned to be my mentor
 my boyfriend refuses to make any decision for me
 which i will write about later in my diary by candlight
 why was i such a piece of shit
 i'm just sick of it all
 she's a lesbian so didn't think much about it
 trying to come up with reasons to get out
 was told 'its scoliosis
i really really don't want to do this thing called life anymore but i can't do anything about it at my friends house anyways
 she didn't seem impressed
i feel so isolated lonley and down
 the only one without moral grey areas
 if i was going to be exiled for helping
  and i don't necessarily mean the extreme where you actually have a method ready
i don't know how else to feel
 and it's making me so confused and tired but all i know is the times when i feel down are getting significantly for frequent and intense and it's scaring me
 i have always had really bad ears and have had so many infections and had to have operations to drain fluids
i can't even connect with others who suffer from depression
 i feel alone and sad and pathetic
 if it doesn't
i stopped taking my medication again
 now i feel so worthless
 i guess she means well
 it comes flying at me
 i feel like my mood is changing dangerously
 my heart goes out to all on this forum who are hurting
 i'm tired of the constant battle and see no light at the end of the tunnel
 just that i liked hanging out because it got me out of this lonely rut i'm in
 i was late
 i hate talking
 from when i was raped at 13
 washing the knives i was tempted to harm myself
right now i am unstable after a better day saturday
 which is hard to live with
 i couldn't read
 i'm sorry that i abandoned you
 and i should look at the psych clinic for their brochure and see if it was something for me after all
 i keep telling myself that
 i have tried being there for him but i don't know how
 shit i didn't even cry which is a first
 but i still have some misgivings
 well time to go
i think the irony here is work lies in mental health
  like that's gonna make me feel better
 i tried to stretch but it all only seemed to make me worse
 no nothing except a very aware brain that makes every second of this living hell feel like a million years
i'm waiting to wake up one day and be completely fine
 they didn't question it
 i felt the need to confess
 i would be a complete ass if i honestly thought he did
 i am sick of fighting
 woke up to a grey cloudy day a reflection of how i feel
the suicide/depression paradox hurts me
 spent 2 weeks on the psych ward after i was determined to be a threat/harm to myself
 i spend hours watching conspiracy theories and false flag videos
 and treated like crap ever since i was a little kid
 i'm tired of being strong
 what if she starts to miss her mum and i can't calm her down
i use to come on here all the time 
 what the heck
 took out her phone to get a pic of the road
 if no one likes me the way i am
im just a fucking ulgy fat mug that never get a fucking girl
 but i still dont know what i did wrong
 called the dog over; had music in one ear and calmed myself as much as i could and forced myself to look at the buildings
i feel such anxiety not knowing if i'm hated
 its not worth it
 i'm super insecure about my body
i just don't know what to do anymore and as i move forward i often find my myself contemplating how such an inability will play itself out moving forawrd
 along with the reasons i went into that specific crisis center are making me feel panicked
 i said i've already given up so much
 i can't sleep
 so i have no way of accessing crucial account information
 i mean im still here alone in my bed wishing to be dead
 i guess that's what depression is
 i guess i'm ok with not knowing too many people at uni though
 after they moved to north carolina about 3 years ago
  we used to hang out together
  sometimes i feel like she's only tolerating me
 people assume that i'm sick or that there's something wrong with me
so i did just that
 taking my bag away and hiding it
 i am still indescribily exhausted
 hopefully my husband can help me talk to the kids correctly
so i was walking home the other morning with my boyfriend at 7 ish in the morning in osaka
i just
dont even know what to write
 i hate the fact that i look at life so mathematically
and another thing
 wednesday i can clean the toilet
 i'm not sure i'll ever get it back
 and tried calling her a few times
 i know i can't work now
 made me feel like i was having seizures
just yeah
 i felt good for awhile then i wake up one morning back to square one
 even right now
 there's been times i wake up and pretend to still be asleep because i can feel him move my blanket trying to take pictures of them
 since clearly he needs help
 i am getting so sick of being treated this way and so i foght back this time and told her maybe she needed her ears checked
 don't know anymore
 life-ending
 losing money
 which is screaming louder
  obviously i don't expect anyone to read every entry since i'm sure on days when there is a lot on my mind
 but right now
 not totally but enough
 no friends whatsoever
what is this place for
 probably in a hotel
  i just got to remember to take my meds on time
 while i understand that she may have been concerned because she thought i genuinely wasn't eating enough
 why are photos so important
i miss having actual friends
 her other friend had finished exams
 but rather just the thought that you still wish that you could "go" pretty soon
 i sleep a lot
 so i just stood there like a maniac hoping he would come back but he didn't
 trying so hard to change myself
 on the other hand my stomach didn't kill me last night so i guess it helped a little bit
 if i could take a pill to rid myself of all emotions
 but i'm not allowed to anything more than walking
 seeing that written on this site gave me the biggest buzz in years that i might get decent advice
 she kept staring at me
 so i babysit when they are both at work
an hour later i went back to bed
 i only woke up after 1pm
 it's tearing me apart
just want to get this off my chest because i feel totally alone
 i'll crawl to the kitchen and get myself some lunch and my pain relief
  i would like to find the courage to meet people
  honestly this might be no more than boredom
and now i am alone
 but it wasn't
 she's not used to being ridden much
 i'm usually confused on my own feelings and have experienced many life changing events
 but after that things changed
i hate my brain its my own worst enemy
 then when we went inside for form i sat in my seat in silence and only spoke when my name was called out on the register
 but was just looking for some input on what the cause might be
 and he reassured me that i should be alive
  i don't know why
 i don't know  how to stop thinking of death or how it may be
 first thing he asks me to do is read something to him from my account page on their site
i'm the lonely girl in the corner
 but by then
  the first time i thought i was just being stupid
  however
 how do you tell this to people
 took it this morning
 but im stuck and i dont know what to do
 fuck my life
at any rate this is how the story goes
 i don't feel sorry for myself either
what the fuck is wrong with you
 then i get a text
 i've tried therapy
yesterday i think i lost my best friend
 if i even hurt anymore
  so far every love i had was a one sided crush
i made a list of 10 things i want to change to make my life better
 that i let that lonely monster take control of me
 but sometimes things can send me into an anxiety-filled frenzy that is difficult to come out of
 and lately i've been having suicidal thoughts again
 sometimes i feel it is better if i don't exist at all
 i am tired of being lied to
 afraid
 this term we were doing football  needless to say i'm horrible at pretty much every sport
 but what terrifies me even more is the fact that i am growing to accept this way of thinking as fact
 if you make a point to show everyone that you can do yoga on a horse
 and i checked my blood-sugar again
when i got to school and it was time for forms (20 minute registration classes at start of the day) i saw everyone else in my form standing with their friends
 i try so hard to treat my body with all the respect it deserves
 i just feel
 the last person who cared about me passed away last year and it's been a downward spiral since
 i feel like things will only get worse from now on
 i would direct you to other services but they have gone under
 as a college student under high stress
 this is hell
  i'd like to start saving money
 the more i get hurt
i am so extremely weary
 and i fell asleep early last night
 my self-esteem is horrible
 i can't look back at all
 i don't want to give people a reason to make fun of me
 i don't really grieve anymore
 i'm just venting
 but it just made me so sad
 it seems like there's no hope or anything to look forward to
 i guess it's stupid but maybe you can figure how desperate i am in that regards
really
 it's all my fault because i'm actively trying to be unhappy
  i would like to work on my poker game
 anyway
 the nearest i get to the sun is seeing it on the net
 i would have done a lot better if i had committed some awful crime and been doing time in a prison cos they let you have an hour of sun there a day i've been lead to believe
 i am trying to avoid medications
today was back to school after 2 weeks off
 i slowly picking the pieces of my broken self and putting my life back together
 i listened to it a lot when i was working my way away from my 'ex' idiot who abused me and forced me into prostitution
 you have to fit a certain list of diagnoses for that
 without help and disabled in my flat and ignored mainly by the state
 and is causing me mood swings
 but you can legally sleep in a snow bank
 he truly saved my life
 but as the title says
 as a grown woman and i felt just as sick
 or that i've dropped out of college because of it
 but not actually being known is the easiest way to do so
 everything i do turns to shit in my hands
tells me to lose her number
 i told them i was so sorry and they took it pretty well
 i have chronic pain
but yeah
 but i stopped only because i fear the pain
 i want to hit my head on the table
 withering
 months ago i saw my doctor again
i get the bus home
 i avoid speaking to alot of people
 dont want to
 but i just don't know how to state my needs again it was hard enough the first time
 if i don't have someone standing behind me and telling me what to do
 damn it
  now that i've realized that parts of it weren't normal
 my mom and siblings don't know about this
 well i shouldn't have another drink
 they think it's just all my fault that i feel this way
 like there is nothing wrong with it
tonight i'm sat here on the floor in my closet of all places and i'm fucking bawling
i know i should be taking off a day or at least half a day every week to rest and regain some energy
 i wish i could be less annoying
i'm just about done with everything
 and after testing every single one of the people that i had any social connection to
 it physically hurts to lift my arms to do anything like write or type and i'm really struggling with the physical stuff at work because i have no strength and feel so tired
 this is only scratching the surface of how i feel
unsure if i have the strength to get through this
5 year tried to commit suicide this past month
 she told me she didnt want to talk
 how do i decide to live again
needless to say
 but i realized that i probably woke up because my blood-sugar was still high--it fucking was
 every contact i had with her has been blocked
 i know what i did
i wish i'd never existed
she misses her dad when he's at work she always has but she has not been away from her mum this long before
 i can't really at the moment because i am broke until next my next paycheck (shocking
 i've had quite enough drama in my life
  i have lived in pittsburgh for 8 years now
 everything is so dark my heart feels black
 monitoring my diet is losing it's effectiveness in distracting me from my suicidal thoughts; it's just frustrating now
 isn't it
 oh god i dont even know what i want to say
 i feel lost as to what exactly is wrong with me
 (no one knew what had happened)
to someone whom i was very close to
 i didn't raise my voice
 unsure how to put it
 just seems like whenever my husband is off at work
 she means well when she says things like "can you handle that
 no less than 30 seconds after putting my phone down
 there has to be a reason
 i'm blind
 she still does
  how do you try again after hiding for so many years alone
and that crushed me for some reason which is ridiculous
but i can't shake it
 i am nothing
  so here's the list:
 then complaining i dont talk loud enough
 there's a road there and he's allowed to run on the field without a leash
 they don't believe in me
 a person i first brought out to the barn to help me with my horse
 letting them keep throwing words at me until the bell went for next lesson
 why i began to speak to inanimate objects
 even though i have no family that wants anything to do with me
 no one shows interest in me but i've gotten used to it
  a child shouldn't be scared that a parent might lash out at them
 usually involving some kind of math/data
 i had a fight with my roomate because she snapped at me for asking her a question as to wether or not she wanted to keep a bottle that was full of liquid or if i could return it
 no one asked
it worries me
 shit happens but it's not the end of the world instead of dreading waking up
 i see no future for what i need to do or what my purpose is or should be
so if i have something that costs å£35 and i want to make a 65% margin i need to take my å£35 and divide it by 0
 runny nose
 none of my friends had turned up yet
 i am trying to work against my anxiety here
so broken
 he said barbara
 and i hope if i write in this every day i will hold myself accountable
 suicide is never an option for me since i have my baby niece and sister who look up to me
 i don't know what trigger me to come back
 she kept asking and tried to dig into what had caused my ptsd
 she gave me a bad reference
 so a normal person might go to sleep around noon
 no idea why i'm writing this
 but it was all lies
 my alarm was set to 7
why do i feel responsible for my family
 i know what i have overcome
 i feel a bit weird tonight
 wtf
 kid
alone in this prison there is a door that never opens
 but he took me to his house 
 when i do
 but those two hours that i spent contemplating suicide felt ephemeral
 i sat at the bar and didn't say anything else to her
 i'm so depressed
 i have been thinking i was tired
 either
 the breed of horse that still runs in a few wild herds in the united states
  it is exhausting
 earlier if i go straight home
she was done with me
 but i met her on here
 so i knew i wouldn't be able to stop her
 my family are embarrassed of me and they have even said it so that is factual
she's just so busy
 i can only idle away so much time before i lose myself to suicidal ideation
 hollow
 i had been addicted to paracetamol as a teenager
but i'm just miserable
 i'm tired of trying to act like everything is okay and wearing a mask for others to see
 i need to be kind to me
 or even a friend or a neighbor
 i'll be in bed by 10am
  we didn't spend a lot of time together
 thinking it will go out the other way
 i made myself bleed a little not too long ago by messing with the scabs covering the places where i'd minorly injured myself a few days ago and thought about making some new ones
  if that means starvation and death well that is your own fault for some reason i can't fathom
 talking to him even about small things is extremely difficult because he has held a pattern
 but other days
 she didn't give me any until i broke her down enough to make her say something
 i eat
 i don't know who to talk to because no one knows i'm still seeing him
i'm easily pushed over my tolerance levels anymore
 but apparently it is
 empty inside
 i would stare at some form of written material and bounce my eyes from one word to the next but it was as though i was reading some foreign language
 am i really that annoying and such a burden
 they don't answer their phone
 i cleaned my freezer
" kind of stupid
 i tried online dating in the past but guess what were my problems (a) weird people on there
my mom is a single parent and i've only been back with her for the past 6 yrs
  not pictures to prove that you were there
gotta go
 i mean when you start talking and everyone just turns away
 lately fantasize about killing my self on an almost daily basis
 and i was just contemplative and feeling especially suicidal
i don't understand at all
  right now i have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet on my ankle and be on a curfew
 about me or another family member
 i went to an ear doctor a few years ago
 who do i contact next
  what repeats
it does make sense  now though
 but a lot of people seem to have no idea that healthy bodies can come in all shapes and sizes
 because she just won't listen
 any input would be much appreciated
 i feel very lost in my life and i know i have several demons to slay and i am hoping maybe someone(s) can help me find my way again or just tell me if i am going the right way
 waiting to go in
 obviously)
 lasting even just a day
 today i have the final proof; further loss of hearing
 palpitations
 a state where i mindless followed his orders
 really
recently
  i'm a lot to handle
 whom i was supposed to have an appointment with today
 despising what i see in the mirror just because i don't fit society's standards of what a "real girl" should look like
i just can't
 and i just don't believe that
ear doctors are another trigger for me
 or that the pizza man will try to come in my house and rape me
i can't seem to recall any happy memories right now
 and i think even try get sick of me some times
 eventually
 even writing this looks like the epitome of self pity
 i wasn't feeling impulsive--just ill-fated
 my partner is the sweetest guy ever
 people just want to tell me off or whatever
 and really i think she is just seriously sleep deprived
  i don't necessarily mean that extreme
 hugs them ect
 and i haven't been talking to anyone in general
  i won't have anyone to talk to
 i let everyone else's words get to me
 she had a "boyfriend"
 or smothering
  through most of my rocky college experience leading up to my move
 the wrong clothes
 through any means possible
but i'm still broken
oh my goodness i was not expecting that
 it's a really big sign that you're annoying
but my friend said she is going to take every shift possible and thay could mean her being away for a week or two at a time
hey guys
i just keep thinking too much
  why can't this stuff happens when he's home or when he's with me
 but i don't know for sure
 carrying heavy groceries
 first of all she left me a message and told me to come for an appointment on wednesday
 anxiety
 when your sick or not feeling well like you have lately
  it might seem silly
  i told her that i think a man touched me when i was like maybe 3-4
 i wouldn't mind answering a couple questions about myself but i guess it's mostly going to bore the other person
 i just bury myself in my video games
  i don't want to do things as well
" people aren't understanding today
 manipulated
 the therapist i talked to at the psych er a week ago told me that
 that i looked sick
but i didn't
 i mean
 putting weight on me as the only one to care for her
 but i had to stop for financial reasons
 not for long anyways
my best friend couldn't stop commenting on my weight when i saw her a few days ago
 but as i washed my hands i saw a weird shadow
i'll probably lie here and watch netflix instead of sleeping
 just because i need to take care of my own needs too
 my mum told me they were seeking a medical secretary at an ear doctor in this town
 writing and joking with my boyfriend who came online at 8
 i demanded explanations
 at this point i'm waiting to see to see something good happen to me for once
 which is a bad place for me to be
 (high school bullies)
 it's just too much and i don't feel like doing anything at all
 my mood the last few days has been dipping more and more
 (and avoided talking about the fight because i didnt think she needed to know nor did i care to talk about it) she told me ok
 broken promises
 i feel like i've gone back to my teen years
 everyone hates me
 i used to be a sun worshiper and it worked as an anti-depressant for me when i was out on my bike all the time
 i am beyond freaked
  now i'm struggling in my relationship with her again
 instead of understanding that i was trying to be helpful she ended up blocking me
 "just do it
 because i could eat as much as i want in front of people when i finally became comfortable with it
 i don't care if living like a robot would be worse
 even people who i thought weren't the judgemental type
i'm the lonley girl in the corner 
 which is of course my fault
 i cant take it anymore
 was misdiagnosed as several contrasting disorders by different doctors who didn't even attempt talk therapy
 i am feeling fucking done
 i was given a tentative offer which would become final once the reference and background checks were completed
 i could barely walk for 2 days after a session
 almost three months ago and for the past almost month i can feel it
 for some reason
 i dont want to die
 it is small and probably harmless
 ive not been cutting like i used to and that now i am keeping a good balance on my life
i have 'realized' i am still sick
 i don't know if it is because i am so simply so fed up with the feeling that i know what i want to do with my life but my current academic trajectory is nowhere near my goal
 when friends ask me how i'm doing i say tired
at lunch (after 4th lesson) i sat down
 i'm still so taken aback
 this is all to say that by that point i have not already relapsed into major drug abuse and am either in jail
 ever since i was a kid
 time
 the only exercise i'm allowed is walking
 i honestly know i will never physically harm myself i just don't see a point of hurting yourself while hurting
 i staggered down the stairs
that's why i developed voices
 the way i act and live is wrong
 if only i could see an end to it
 i've gone to her place a few times and we usually got starbucks before the barn
 i know i am able to not be in this cycle -- i did it for years so now i just need to let go
i am just so sick of having pains and essentially being handicapped
i am unfortunate enough to have an 'invisible' handicap
 fraudulent charges on my credit card
 having no one to ever go anywhere with down to the rapists family pestering and trying to draw me out to being extremely promsicuous when younger
so the problem is that i always feel so conflicted about everything
 i suppose it's cause easter just passed 
 but in this state of mind its so difficult to do any of the things i know i need to do
i have stayed away and yet i long to talk to you again
 i know i don't read things properly because i'm so distracted with pain but i really did have some hope there until i read it
 everyone watched me and eventually the teacher told me to sit down and went onto explaining today's lesson
i don't want to be depressed
 the more i care
 that void
 i don't want to burden others with my dark feelings
 i was on some for a little while
  i spoke to my pcp
 tells me that when she spoke with the other university
 "well (at this point
social anxiety and depression are destroying me
 it seems impossible to me but i am holding out a minimal amount of hope that someone could actually love me
so i told my mom that i had been feeling anxious this past year and had talked to a doctor
 but the truth is even if i was skinny i'd still have pains (yes
 i need to be up at 9:15-9:30 to get to work on time
in this day and age
 which is surely the opposite effect that people should be going for
 i'll just be a cynical
  i have limited interests and don't like large social gatherings; resulting in people having to choose me over their friends
loads of people i know are getting married
 sorry for writing all this shit here but it had to leave my head (although i don't expect it to not actually bother me again in like a couple hours or so you know)
i endured severe bullying in school too and even on the school bus
 i "do" say stop
 whether it was reading
 and whats hurting me the most
 and getting sick of being put down
 and on top of it i'm losing one of my best friends
 maybe a little less
 but it had been weeks of bad dreams waking up feverish thinking i was pregnant or had a baby
 i even hate hearing my name being called out for fear of being stared at
 especially after how poorly i treated it during my teen years
 the victim blaming rhetoric is really starting to get me angry
i can't take this anymore
 i got into doing some things for her
 ive told people before but it didnt get better because of it
 i wish i could exercise to help me lose weight
 so i decided that i would rather her be mad at me than for her to not be here at all
nobody sees or hears
 why am i the one "bothering" everyone else
in the midst of the feelings
on the other hand: people tell me that depressed and suicidal people like me are the worst people ever
 i'm sure it'll pass
i don't know how to say what i need amongst all this as i know they need the money desperately and as i said i am glad to help
 and if i am too active it hurts more and sometimes it locks nerves
 nope
i'm not expecting this newfound mindset to last forever
errrr
 in retrospect my life has been a constant battle with anxiety
 that should i fail
 my boyfriend of 3
 thinking back i am realizing i did all the wrong things
 either texted or called each other
 or at least i think they do
 i now hate the way i look
 god forbid i eat a cookie
 i will be subjected to the whim of fate
 and the thing was supposed to start on thursday
i always said her i dont want her to touch me
 there has been several dozen situations in the last month where i would sit down for a minimum of an hour and get nothing done
 i only have friends online
 it was the last time i saw my father 
 i just feel like i'm supposed to be a 'good girl' and get a job and work hard
 probably the prospect of another dark empty day
  to attempt to mold form to the erratic and crushing and mad-flailing pings and chokes and hiccups of emotional failings
 and then he came back after about 15 minutes obviously worried and was so confused what was wrong
 am i just dysfunctional
 instead of living them
 so i came out from that fight with my roomie to meet up with her and needed to get my service dog in training out (he had been couped up for 2 days) so i told her i would bring him
 not once have i judged someone for being overweight
 å£35/0
 what do i fix first
 she managed to get pics of almost everywhere we went
 i'm stuck so stuck
 i tried to convince myself i would be fine
 i know that i annoy everyone
 they just told me what i had said
 since my last posts i've gotten better in some aspects
 they don't think that happens to a 26 year old
 but this
 i just feel so lost
 lie
  i know it takes time and know what to do and avoid
 i "do" speak up
 yet when a girl is underweight or even just a bit thin like i am
  but i need to start this thread to laugh a little
 monday i can vacuum
 when my aunt was complaining about stuff i found the silver lining
 i've been on blood thinners since the last time 2010
 part of me wishes i had never discovered this
i feel so much regret
  cleaning isn't going well and my kids don't care
 i don't know if it's just that i am lazy
  i asked my best friend about it and she said her mom must have gone through her phone
 i'm just going to lay in bed day and night until i waste away
then when i got on the bus to go to school i started shaking and crying quietly because i was so scared of going to school
3 months ago i was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol a second time
i'm worthless
 this is why i am afraid to call my psychiatrist
  speak to no one
 i go up into my room and started vibing to some gorillaz
i feel so empty
 and social anxiety but i hope in time things will get better
 so we were pretty much destined to pair up on the first project of the school year
 i just can't take it
 where i feel nothing at all
 i've since deleted her number
i also feel like my mom is closeted lesbian so she kinda tries to satisfy some of her repressed urges
 the point is
 they are paying me minimal amounts and i'm not doing it for the money it's just a bonus for me
 good guys sink to the bottom of an abyss and are left to die
 just that
 at least for a few hours a day i can take my mind off of the bitter hatred i feel towards everyone and the horrible thoughts that fill my mind
 mostly because i am one
 they would still look at me in disbelief and dismiss the idea
 these are the times when i feel i am ready to do it
carly is the biggest slow-poke of a horse you ever saw
 no response
" or do stuff for me
 and whenever i try to gain it
 should i go to the doctor if the thing just landed on me
 i shouldnt have to mediat between emotions and my thoughts
 and still now he can instill fear in me
 i don't really have a life after all
when my friends/ former friends picked me up in the car
 i tried them all
 i have severe ptsd and cannot cope right now even though dbt is helping me some bit
 should i stop medication or should i call my psychiatrist
 i'm losing my mind 
 (sorry if squeamish guys are reading along) but my period was irregular for years
 and this entire town feels like a trigger
  all you were doing was causing me to go into hiding
 i've been fighting this wave of depression like there's no tomorrow
 but i feel sooooo bad about my self tonight
 i even went outside while waiting for it to finish
 i get paranoid about crazy things
  foods are making me more nauseous
  it was very awkward
 i took all the acting classes i could in school
 and it is eating at me
but that was never why i was referred there
 it's downright mentally cruel
 micky
 i just want relief from this constant state of exhaustion
 she had no reason to add her unwarranted 2 cents
i am sitting at my desk trying to calm myself down and hating myself for being stupid
 the dysfunction of my current department has nothing to do with my potentially new job
 my mind screams for suicide but my body cant do it
i feel some minor relief in pretending that i'm valuable to somebody
 nowadays i wake up go to school then go sit at the marina and stare at the ocean there's nothing poetic about it i just get bored
actually bad week
 hoping if i was someone might like me
i got my coffee and greek yogurt
 or am i in the wrong
 she was the sole reason i still existed
 she said that was fine and wouldn't expect me to do it that often
 can't can't
 many in fact that has proven to me that talking is ineffective but its what i'm supposed to do right
but i don't want to mess up your life
 meds
 it has certainly affected my capacity to write and sleep
 i wish i could actually do something right for once
 well all students get anxious about stuff
 i even got scolded for not overcoming my anxiety from my mom
 and i have to run out of there
  this lack of anonymity
 and never any concrete plan or course of action
 that i'm making everything about me and that they really don't care about me
 if my profit is 100% but my margin in that instance would be 50%
 you're all good people and i'm sorry you suffer this curse of depression/anxiety and all the other mental tortures that have descended on you
 it was a horrible meeting and i left it shivering and almost cried on the street going home
 this has occurred over the course of 4 months
  a child shouldn't be told they are stupid and bad at certain things
 i thought i just had experiential trauma from all of the dysfunctional family relationships growing up
 or refuses to go in a straight line
 he's been really patient with me
 one to one therapy wasn't for me
 while grasping ice cubes tightly in my hands
 my classmates would think that my small frame was entirely due to the fact that i never ate
  why would it be any different if i tried again
 lost home
i have been very panicky for the last 24 hours
and i really don't need more excuses to stay in my flat and not go outside
 i feel like a failure
  always had a counter argument
 he said he is in a weird place and is confused
i've been having a strange issue with my new laptop
 and since then i didn't even take aspirin for bad period cramps
 i woke up a few hours later
i wasn't even a human being at that point
 i just don't want to be alone
i'm beyond exhausted
 but i refuse to let it be the end of the world
 i should maintain a clean room and more funny stuff in the next point
what could i do to feel better
feeling exceptionally depressed
 he's getting old
 and in the end she decided instead of the chronic pain curse she wanted me to join an anxiety group
it's odd to say
 anyways
 i was being stupid
 and not just to live
 but it goes in one ear and out the other
 and no scans
 i hate looking at myself in the mirror and seeing my ugly
 which was made worse after a friend killed himself around 1 month ago
 i'm not crazy
 wish i could feel optimistic but the depression is so heavy on my body and mind
 i felt for him a bit
 i don't have the courage to make that final commitment and i don't have the courage to live
 that's the worst
 and i just kept sobbing and it wouldn't stop
 he actually reached the women and i managed to call out to them that he's not dangerous
 there are so many ways to let go
 spotty face
 apparently she is
 but that's not the point
 i have been devastated since i spoke with my pos reference this morning
 after being depressed and in treatment for over 10 years
 but i actually gave up on it around 8 months ago
 like
 i feel terrible of myself
 but yet it is so difficult for us to feel the same way about ourselves
 and especially since the last time i saw my therapist
 hope to get through the rest of this pregnancy okay
 you've been head****ing my daughter
 after three years of being mentally and physically beat down
 i can feel the pain inside
 i'm so lonely
 i haven't been talking to anyone specifically about my depression lately
why i never get laid
 yet i still crave having somebody that actually wants to talk to me
 it was a relief when i finally got it
 everyone was really shocked
 so i sat by myself
 but she's like so
 i don't help myself much
  i knew something was wrong right away
i heard crying in the background
 trash
carly's basically a mustang
 there 2 elevators were out of service
 my mom would be heartbroken
 fuck that
 i cried for a couple of days after hearing that
 i've yet to self-harm since december
 so completely devoid of companionship
 another thing i am sick of is the looks people give me when i go for an elevator at all
  i fear death when the suicidal thoughts aren't there
 we had been out drinking together the night before
 not something i want because i would like for him to relax and rest after he's worked all day
 cant go either way
i'm not sure if this is the right place but i didn't really know where to put it
 followed some time down the line by an eclipsing depression based in the fact that my life has become the punch line of some tragic joke
 help me or even talk to me
 i lived off of toast i'd crawl to the kitchen to get
i don't know
  all i do know is they both hurt they are screaming
 do people think i am incapable to make my own decisions
 which i did
 so it does make me hopeful
 wet the bed while i slept
 i'm basically incapable of maintaining a conversation
 i don't even care if my girlfriend comes over anymore
 he took me to hurt my mother 
 the alternate fate of my mother
 but doesn't do that with me at all
brian
 my tummy was sagging down
 and i thought i was doing a good job on at least keeping the suicidal feelings away but now they're back
 when i got to my uncle's this morning
 it's supposed to be every 6 hours
 i let him back in
 always ends the same
 it's very frustrating to have this label pinned on me for as long as i remain thin
 only to fall back to severe depression/anxiety
 there are people like me who are desperate to go
 just wanted to complain with a post
 we got into small groups and did dribbling practise but i felt as if everyone was watching me the whole lesson as i was slow and really bad
 who's been more of a friend than anyone to me
 so for all i know no one is fixing it
i have to admit it feels a bit weird
 i can't do amy work anymore but i feel like i can't tell anyone because they would just dismiss it as being lazy
i turned on my computer and the sun came up
 i asked him if i could get a scan
 make excuses
 i feel no fear
  and it turns out my hearing was a lot better than i knew
 but i thought with my therapist i would be safe enough to speak the whole truth
 i send some texts frequently over the last couple of weeks
 i am alone
 "i'm worthless
 and in january and february i was mostly not thinking about it anymore even though i was still feeling terrible
 jobless and depressed
i am not really expecting anyone to explain this to me - apparently i am far too fucking stupid to understand if you try
 no way i am canceling that
walking back home the school where i was severely bullied for 8 years and sexually abused was in full view
 i called the manufacturer and tried to explain what happens
 i can't handle life
sa-chan
i was told to focus on doing things i like
the dog loves to go to the field next to mum's house
 but tonight
 this is the second thread i started
 i live with dishes cluttering my tiny kitchen that has no space already because washing the dishes hurts me especially
 memories are starting to come back
 i have nowhere else to go
 *sigh*
 my anxiety has been severe of late
i want to beat the shit out of her when she touches me without my consent
that i barely know
 i was a robot
 it's still wrong
i am a pathetic waste of space
 she just talks about how god will help me or whatever
i think of you daily even though we do not talk anymore
i am so confused right now
 writing
i don't know why i do it
 i don't need vision to know where the peach wine is in my cabinet
 if i'm not telling them
 not sure if it's from my dream last night or because my youngest kept me up most of the night or something else
  i don't know what to think
 pretty much any and all social situations scare the hell out of me
i am starting to suspect i have some degree of ptsd
 i don't work so that's out
 this is due to too many ear infections and various procedures to cure them too
 i am not sure if i want to die or just be numb
 and it makes sense she wanted to show off a little online
 when we talk on the webcam i have to get up and stretch a lot
 i keep trying to not eat and drink
 but the more i try the more upset i get that i'm not moving forward fast enough
 (untreated scoliosis)
 and now i woke up at 4 in the morning feeling numb
 i know they see it
 we stayed close (although i felt reluctant to tell her about depression and suicidal feelings like i did before
i'm sorry
"  i think some people take that to heart
  i tend to go a bit overboard in playing other games that mathematically i know i can't win at
and then the next morning i woke up in a normal mood again
so what does she tell me to do
on a plus i lost 4stone in weight
 emotionally irrelevant
 instead of me always harassing people
so first about my currently greatest problem: i am completely overworked
 one to the train company and another to the kiosk
feeling very ashamed
 medikinet
 male voice on the other side of the phone
 and that i need some assistance in dealing with this because i'm not able to handle it the usual way
 a big pile of nothing
my mom told me i never do anything
sorry for the caps lock
i have to plan my activities every day
 which seem so trivial in comparison to mine
 which i guess is good
 i barely get any sleep nowadays
 i always end up with just another "friend"
 opened my laptop and wrote two complaints
 that they don't want me around
 this would be an understandable assumption to make
 i know the only thing i would be interested in is talk therapy
 there's nothing they can even do to help anyway
 although i hate the idea of me living no more would the world stop turning
 but he didn't do more
 i feel tortured
 nothing works
 i get a call
 its a fixation right now
 it would never get done because she never does any of it
 my suicidal thoughts and hopeless pondering had already consumed me
  tonight i came to the conclusion that i should not be alive
 and he ran past
 what is it about this cycle that appeals to me
 i used to think of suicide only a couple times a month
 but it has stuck with me
 i was kicked out of my home and i've been living with my friend since
 and i wanted her to know about it
 and the pain isn't just over once i leave the stairs
 he's going to leave you"
 hopeless
 i'm hoping that i'm not alone here
 with all these mixed feelings and emotions
 ugh
 when i look in the mirror i see an empty husk who is nothing
 he brought me nothing
 like driving her to places she needed to go
when i was planning my move to san francisco
 and i know it was a joke but he ran away so fast and so far when i looked he was no where in sight
i take comcerta for attention deficit disorder
 but who instead has turned into a sociopath and narcissist
 which was both a relief and very hard and sad
10 weeks pregnant today
 if only there were a timeline on this pain
 again explained that i'm totally blind
i'll just shut up now as i could go on and on
 next
 i wish i could start all over
 i can only distract myself from my own suicidal ideations by throwing myself into helping others with resumes and job searches
 how about motivated to wake up
 (she is in a wheelchair) so i apologyzed but still dont understand what i did wrong
 things i don't want to think about
my grandfather was a musician
 it never ends
sorry in advance
 which in turn hurts in itself
suns out
 no more
that's as much as i write for now and i hope it is enough
 but
 which means
so what does she tell me
 nothing happened
 im ready to have a breakdown just from fighting sleep all day long
 we're both getting frustrated
i am seriously so fed up with myself
 i wish i could find hope
i went into a crisis center on friday afternoon and spent two hours talking to a therapist
 and it's not like i can talk to her about these things
life has been hard and i find myself wishing i was dead
so lately especially i've been taking extreme and quite sudden turns for the worst
 it feels like even in your own death you manage to fail
  everything towards the end of the day was crashing down on me emotionally
 bitch
 i have no friends
 i don't know what to do
 but the last hour can get so painful i only let 5 pass
 about a month ago i started noticing it was harder to focus
 she did lie and she did dump me
my past and present are catching up with me even in my nightmares
 and the last two days i have cried every ten minutes
 have nothing to lose
 fuming and hurting
 wrong hairstyle
  my life seems meaningless 
 the truth was that i had been eating plenty
 trying not to hurt myself over going back to school
 i feel like i just annoy everyone
 this is now the second time that the police have brought me in
  dark depression and anxiety to the point i don't want to leave the house and can't get anything done
 i remember being friendless
 i'm obsessed with watching tragic and depressing videos
 lost friends
 i'm worrying over things that are ridiculous to worry about
 i was pretty weirded out
 i wasn't going anywhere if my body and mind was simultaneously making me feel dreadful
watching tv
 my life is kind of disappointing
 maybe i'm just too lazy
 and thats all i want
anyway
 that i'm gay doesn't make it any more likely for me to actually find someone
 adding to my chronic pain
 i would like to start again
 but she didn't listen to my requests
 this pink huge crayola crayon holder thing 
 or until my parents kick me out then i'll go waste away on the street
 it worries me though
 i've since had another flare up of tonsillitis which did resolve itself
 if i can't realize i've got flu
 i've been thinking so much about telling my family i need help
 i feel like they are the only ones that listen
  i'm drained
 i don't go out (except to the casino
 and because i am still thinner than average
 so i would like to maybe try to fix that
  i would like to get down to around 222 lbs
 i try to do things like draw and i hope to get back to crocheting and maybe even painting
 as he had tried a few times before
 because he had lost another friend through suicide several years ago
i feel hopeless
i have to deduce that i'm just not a good person
 he put what i like to call a deadly idea into my head
i apologize in advance if this is the wrong section for this
 even though it's more than just your casual tired feeling
i just hate that i allowed that to happen
 it never really bothered me to the point of taking action
i am wondering
 not once in my life have i shunned a certain body type
 waiting around
 or when they try to hit on me even though i show that i am not interested or when they act bitter and hostile when i dont say ok to them
 and on the paper my mental condition is not bad enough either
 and although she knew i was really shy and i struggled a bit (because i had only just joined top set this year) she left me until last and i couldn't give a fact
 it feels like people are constantly putting down every aspect about me
 and i did this a couple times
 my head takes over me
  i don't know
 i find a solution
 stuck and alone that they're suddenly coming back full force and i just wish i would have ended everything last year as planned
 i don't need to add drama to my life anymore
 all that ever does is hurt me deeply
 and yet i am still thin
 it won't matter to anyone
 despite the pain
 i was seeing a counselor
  i dont know how i was condesending
 she told me i was condesensing and didnt even bother to knowor ask her how she was going to do things on her own
slowly killing me from the inside
 my aunt is constantly negative about anything and anyone while she just sits on her bum
 a criminal (and that's just my mother
 despite the fact that i am the healthiest i have ever been
another day
i dont know why my roommate and neighbor have been angry and snapping at me lately
 but i got a bright idea
 and complains all the time about henry being in the way
 can i not escape
  i have several things i do where i can make some ‰ÛÏfound money‰Û
 something happened to me a couple of nights ago and it's really stuck with me ever since
 was trying to get stuff accomplished today and not going well at all
 my doctor says i have generalized anxiety
and i took the dog for a walk
 even if it were just my family to feel the pain would whatever family i have whereever down the line not feel the pain
 but a crisis this isn't
 no one would notice or care anyway
i got my laundry done
 and i undid all that today
  ever since this happened i have been really depressed and i feel like i have lost everything
 i can't see
 started whispering my name
 cannot control my thoughts and feelings
 and was waiting on dbt
 it feels like my life is slipping away and i have no idea how to stop it
 i generally only seldom think of actual methods
 i just sunk back into my seat
 i didn't sleep for days
 there's little chance i ever will be
i dont even want to leave the home some days because i dont want to see some males' disgusting faces and stares
  i told him i had trouble believing him
 i thought i would outgrow this as a teenager
 it doesn't seem like a big deal
the kind of stupid that reduces me to tears of frustration and self loathing is the "how can you not fucking get this
when my pains got really bad a couple of years ago i didn't want to get on pain relief
i do not want to commit suicide but life is beginning to seem progressively more and more pointless and i fear my already lacking willpower will not be enough to prevent me from acting out of impulse
 texted her today and asked how she was
 truth be told i was wondering if i could get on disability benefits
 since it explains so much about me
 i can't even walk out the door to go buy paper towels and dish soap
 trying not to let the eating disorder take over for the baby's health
 i just don't know what to think about all of this
and we stopped coming
because i dont know if he can do anything
 my only friends are audrey and shannon
i worry a whole lot about possible upcoming emergency vet bills
 i sometimes get afraid of the 'monster' under the bed grabbing my legs
 saying he wants to visit and the end of the month (he lives over the other side of australia) he has visited me once here and i did not let him come or see my home i meet him out at public places
  my parents received a phone call at approximately 11pm
 i've tried to be strong all my life
 my husband can handle it when he gets home
 i only eat the ones from the butchers"
 i get up because i instantly know what it is
i am already nearly deaf on one ear
 at this point
 i had only had 5 hours of sleep (well 'only' is relative when some nights i only get 2 or less)
 i just want to puke on their faces
 i cant
 but the fact is i'd still hurt if i was skinny)
 well how can i hold a full time job in this condition
 i just feel truly lonely
 i'll see the same thing then that i do now
 i can barely complete the simplest of tasks without having worrying or crying
  i know that they exist
 i let it slide
why did i ruin a perfectly good thing
 then because i was sitting next to him they started picking on me too
but i'm starting to think i still have it
 this was all happening while her other friend was studying for exams
 because i began to not care whether i took them or not
 even though i am past middle age already
those arent accidental touchs
 researching
 so i went to sleep right away
 i can not even get out of bed
 i have another sore under my tongue and another on the inside of my lip
 but yea
 too tired to even question it inwardly
she was too good
 i have recently crashed hard
  i'm panicked i wont be good enough to look after her i'm panicked somthing will go wrong that she will get hurt and it will be my falut
 i need to talk to someone before i lose it
 for my own sake too
 i spend hours debating if i should post or not
 again
 and going to the grocery store
 granted
how crazy am i
 and for months all i could do was lie in bed and sob
 had my hormones tested
 my daily routine
 turns out the only way you can get that is having a mental illness
 i feel like depression doesn't necessarily perpetuate my life--it hastens it
fuckkkkkkkk
 look i made a suicide pun
 do i sound suicidal
 but my curiosity is never satisfied
 really cruel cos i thought any advice on this site would be proper medical advice on how to die in the best way possible with no pain
 i'm always sucking in my stomach trying to be skinnier and trying not to jiggle
 i seem to naturally put them in the most awkward positions ever
 or sensitive
 i'm so sad
it does feel weird to focus on me rather than finding work (to be perfectly honest i would rather live off of writing or something similar from home rather than having to work)
 i can't imagine why i put up with it
 i'm afraid i'll never change
 this happened the next day as well
 etc
tired of feeling lost and alone
 and i completely understand
 i am feeling so awful it was not me too
 i know it'll pass
i have gotten to the point where i no longer care about school
 i feel so wretched about it
i hate talking to males because they say stuff like men are smarter than women or women gossip but men dont or womem should look after a family
 please give us a call back when this happens again so you can verify for us what you see on the screen
i can't really wrap my head around this
this has been an infuriating topic for me for a long time
i'll admit it
and slowly i clawed myself back to life from a zombie like state
 where every few days
but meh
 i could talk to my family
 well i messaged her later in the evening to ask how the canning went
 but it honestly doesn't change the fact that i always end up developing feelings for someone who in my eyes showed me a bit more attention than the average joe
 i weigh a bit too much
 one of my references said that she would hate to lose me but understands why i need to leave
 i told him that not wanting to touch me or wanting me to touch him is painful
 fighting to get my clients what they are owed and need to survive is getting so much harder
 i fear the pain that it will take to reach it
"i mean
 until she broke that all down with just a few words and looks
so i need to figgure out a plan as to why i won't be able to have this vist or why i'll be busy
 and the people in my therapy group were really judgemental
 that's my fault too
 i left her alone for a week once
 but kept telling me i was always welcome to get back in touch
 but i've accepted it happened
 but i only speak the truth
she does so not get it and i don't really know how to make her understand
 blood clots in the lung
 why is it never anyone elses fault
that's not the full truth
 i'm scared to be alone for too long as i feel like everyone is staring at me
now i know it's stupid to start a relationship or anything like that in my current situation since it could only go wrong
 she tells me that she went into the department's dirty laundry
 my mum's dog ran from me towards them
 my family/ acquaintance/ culture isn't even religious so it's not as though they're working within a moral framework that accepts adherence to this type of rule
 i really need to be strong and just let him go
there are things that needs to be done
  i told her if she started to write an m1 hold i would leave at the start of our session
 i feel like i should've just killed myself before i was kicked out
avoid
 i feel like i got completely lost in all this
 that's a problem
 and people respond with "pic or it didn't happen
  occasionally pig out and end up throwing up but i'm slowly getting there
 panic instead of letting me talk
 i've had this ambition to at least pointlessly make it past another birthday
 i just wish i could be skinny
 and i was so worried i had become pregnant
 i don't want people to need me and i don't want to need others either
  it's a free shot at money so with no risk its positive expectation
 i want these thoughts to stop
that's is better of dead
 although it's much worse than before i just don't care at all anymore
 morning always seems to be the worst
 i'm scared to be firm with her and don't know how to do it properly(with her) she is not a difficult child at all she is quiet good but i'm just scared
 they're really close-minded in general) so i can't even get myself to tell them i have it
 fatigue
 don't give people hope when there is none
 it was not a method in how to end your suffering
 well anyone coming on this site knows only too well what makes people want to die
 he shows lots of anger to me
 i wouldn't date/befriend/touch me so i don't expect anyone else to either
 i contacted my counselor
 he's also mentioned his foot fetish and how he wants pictures of my feet for the express reason of masturbation
 why is it hugely shocking to insult an overweight girl
 it's just a better game than slots as far as payout over time is concerned
 i said i dont know
im not even upset at my life at this point
i'm struggling and i really just need to vent
 technically it's just bricks and mortar now
 i worried it was pcos
 dare i say it was kind of cute
 how betrayed they must feel
 i already get set off by things that remind me of him and i don't want anymore
  this whole thing seems very self-absorbed to me
primarily because it was the last song my grandfather sang to me before he died
 and sometimes i'd take a few more slices so i had for the next meal next to my bed as well
 i guess i'm ok with only having 2 or 3 friends from high school but as stupid it would be with my current life circumstances i still wished i had a boyfriend
the irony of  all this is that we lost a family friend to suicide a few years ago
i flat out told the professionals that if you started writing those holds i would leave
 i tried going back to sleep
if only i can disappear
i don't even cry anymore
 still trying hard but am managing
im just tired
 but i kept forgetting to do refill
 but the thoughts are there
 i mean desperate to die
 but i get the feeling that no matter how close i get she'll still have trouble finding time to see me
 completely void
 caffiene does nothing anymore
 going through terrible things
 i can't control myself
 i guess i'll be a scrooge my whole life
 i mean yeah im safe and all but its kind of wishing i wasnt
 she also got mad at me for not knowing how to drive
 having to always work and never being able to catch up or earn enough stability to have children
 but fear gripped me again
 i sometimes get sad
  things needing to be done and i feel useless
 one way or another we are all headed there eventually
 i just wonder why it's like this
 but who knows who i'll be when i've been helped
 then dropping out of school as a result of lack of motivation
 and when i'm sick that balance gets even worse
i just put my best friend to sleep not even 12 hours has passed
imagine after you feel everything is going to be okay now
 in reality
 i think i may die soon anyways
 i just turned 64 and wish it were over
 my former/ lost friend began practicing yoga regularly
 that in particular made me feel even more helpless
like wtf
 ‰ÛÏi am sorry due to funding cuts you are on your own
 i just need to pig out on some ice cream and chocolate
 and i had been trying to talk her out of it
 but it couldn't have been more than a few days
  it can feel like it won't end
 i knew what it was before they told me
 i feel like this endless battle should really be ending soon
 i don't see a way out of this hell
 i just needed to get this out somewhere 
 most are either only there to actually study or they are with friends they already know
  she was angry that i had talked my way out holds in mid-march
i did things to avoid arguments from happening
 already want the baby to be here but mostly to go back to restricting
 but it's not anything serious
 and he agrees to circle the charges for me and handle it personally
making bad decisions and having this repeating cycle
 i feel nobody could care about me at all unless i can benefit or help them its the only time people contact me
 i don't do anything because i don't know what to do
 i want to fight
 angry and thinking that dying is the way to go right now
 but that shouldn't be
 leaving would mean never seeing him again
 god
 they're burning and i have a migraine too
 my computer
 i even managed to make a plan for my last trip
 so here i am
 the only person i feel comfortable talking to is unavailable right now
sorry
 i am just numb and flat
it hurts so bad to know i got to that point
 when he goes out with them not answering his phone to anyone
 i am on my own and have been for some time
 missing a few people that have passed away and am very stressed
 the years i was on zoloft
 i talk more to my long distance friends about it and another close friend here who isn't in school with me
 i will always be a sore loser who will always be talentless and friendless 
my life was saved though
 empty
last november
things build up over decades until they become unbearable
now i just feel like none of it matters
i saw my therapist today
 i hate that my parents thought that they needed kids
 i'm behind in almost every class and i have no motivation or concentration to care or catch up
 i have written a lot of letters including the goodbye ones
 i hadn't even bothered writing a letter
 it's taken courage to even get to this point
i have never felt so bad in all my life
 so tired
 only accepting a cure which does not exist
what should i do
 i was in the shower and found him in the garage
 so more money to pay out
 my mind is so broken at this point that i'm a danger to people around me
 i met someone
 i spend the night sleeping on the couch but my mind kept thinking of how much i have been failing
 losing a child
 then she went on accusing the things that i haven't done - stealing
i've never felt so alone before
 since i was younger
how long is necessary to pretend to be good for it to come true
 i have always been isolated since birth
i could never ask for anything better
 the first therapist i met with referred to my life as i described it as a big pile of shit
 in the morning when my boyfriend asks how i am ill probably just say 'fine'
 from having bad side affects to not being able to sleep to hearing voices and seeing people
i'm a college student
i've been told that i'm not a failure
 don't have the courage to kill myself
 overextended the problem is i took my work for granted and let myself coast
 i've self harmed
 i don't see a point to this
 what choice do i have
 i crave the comfort of religion but i just can't bring myself to ever believe in that
 but he doesn't need me to be down
 i'm afraid that if i move out
 blurry vision and it's not like our life is terrible but i'm young and i feel so whipped
 if i can make it look like an accident
 because quite frankly who would read it or care
 i was born with a severe clef lip and palette which took many surgeries to mostly fix
tiger skye
 i'm afraid to do something
 to name but a few
 i feel overwhelmed
 too much to do
 having the same thought again
 really unwell
 but i finally found friends with whom i could connect
 and nobody bothered or cared to look down at my dead body
 so yeah
 i hate this world
 it was and has always been me
 and eventually realized i no longer make new friends
 the more i want to listen to that little voice in the back of my head
 yet they refuse to do anything
 i'm not a killer
 i don't want to get it wrong
 i been pushing everyone away
 and i spend everything i make
 i resent having these kids but i don't resent the kids themselves
 it's all just too much and feels like i am going to explode
 i realize i have depression and i'm not fond of that and i just think every gets sad
i don't know what to say
 my feelings hurts
 to put it bluntly
 install myself <edit - methods>
 i don't want to keep hurting but it seems inevitable no matter what i choose i'll be leaving something behind
 i have been trying to do my work but unsuccessfully
 if you want me gone i understand because everyone else does but my wife
 this is probably due to the fact that i feel i've dealt with an unfair amount of pain throughout my life and i feel it isn't fair that everyone else isn't experiencing the same pain as i am
 those were my first time i feel so empty
 something i do not want to live with
 not wanting to involve another human being in my demise
 i hate how i'm too shy to speak to people
i don't want to feel a thing
 suicide seems logical and rational
 my pastor and the rest of those hypocrites didn't help 
 i felt like no-one would care anyway
my dreams are crushed
 stupid problems at work with boilers and internet not working etc and people making it hard for me to sort out
 my mind refuses treatment
 i wanted no commitments
 how right now i'm on here with the chance of having at least one other person read this across the globe while i continue through the week and grow and age
 people are too busy working and having lives - things i don't have anymore
 i have so much pain psychological and physical
 i'm so drained emotionally and physically
 the whole lot
 and everything is just so screwed up
 this caused a bad spike
 i am leech and a monster
 but i'm not
so much pain right now
 it was work related
i began writing secret letters so that i would be able to see my progress
 but for now i am just pretending
 i've been posting a lot lately cause i'm emotional and i tend to get very sensitive by things
 i can't afford the pills
no one would miss me because there is nobody left
 who is trying to get better
 why can't i be better
 i suddenly couldnt do my job
i keep having a lot of nightmares it got to the point that every time i go to sleep i beg god that i don't have a new nightmare 
 i have ruined my life
 someone who
i poured my heart out to him
 we live with her mom who has paid and continues to pay for everything for us over the last 7 years
 which was planned around her only
i think about my tinnitus all day at work
 i get these thoughts of self harm randomly when positive things aren't going well for me such as my relationship
i am not exactly sad
 i kept finding small problems that kept me awake and tried to solve them
 i drink and smoke so that i can calm down or at least go to sleep
 this would lead to me losing the internship
 its not worth it
 that is why i want to do it
 and i just need my friends back
 so that i could die in bliss
i am now ready to try again as its the only way i see
 i don't want to live anymore
 make me seem ungrateful
 waste of time
 i can't bear the irony of failing a suicide attempt
 i feel stuck because i chose poorly in the past
 i used to get top marks in one of my classes every week when we did our weekly test but now i've gone down to c's
 ugly
 i was expecting it hours earlier
 three dilemmas
 yet i feel nothing
 i decided to turn my life around
i'm really insecure about myself
 i hate this country
 tears keep falling out of my eyes
to think that i was worrying about what i would talk about with my counselor at my next appointment
 he didn't quite understand it because no one who doesn't suffer from it could fully understand it
i often think my death
i'm all ears
 then my car got towed from a place we have always been allowed to park
 no admittance to hospital
 i'll mess up so much
 he is now in high school
 though my psychiatrist would not diagnose this
i just wish i would stop being here
 it feels like i'm being bullied by my own different ghosts
 but does that honestly stop you from saying
 i wasn't ready to see his lifeless body around that corner
 so wasteful
 i don't know how to answer that question
 i don't want anyone to think badly of him
 everyone seems to want something from me in the chaos following my divorcing my parents
but i don't know
 i feel like i'm always looking back
 years and years of therapy can't undo the damage that was done to me as a little girl and i don't want to even grow older
 i feel like i'm not good at anything and compliments on things i do just make me feel bitter and exhausted because i don't want to pretend i agree with people who think i do anything right
i cant hold or hug people
 drowning in those unreal feelings i felt whenever i imagine myself in certain situations
 i should have left her
 this post doesn't even give details of why this has come about
 if this was a place negative comments where allowed
i don't know what to do anymore
 with my current sick baby
 it's on the inside where none of it feels good
 who is mentally fragile
 because they started to get bad again
 and began to realize that i hated the person i had become
 and the reason i finally had enough was that i was forced to attend my rapist's birthday celebration
 it would take a neighbour complaining about the smell that would lead someone to my body
 too bad they are not life-threatening
 i am trying not to fall further
 i recently went on a psychological course
 eventually i would get a pyschotic break
 one employer has already stated no go yet have not heard from other 3
 and almost made me forget all about my sadness and my anxiety
 and death keeps racing through my mind
 let me die let me die let me die
 thrive
 damn it hurts
 here i was
 i feel like i should just give up
 i feel like me leaving this world is the only thing i can think off
 i can't continue that
this is weird
 why am i even still alive
 or to allow myself to be vulnerable enough to do so
 if everyone were to drop dead around me i feel i wouldn't have any problem with it at all
 and it doesn't seem like i worry about the consequences
 i just needed to talk
i don't have any family
 it broke through my numbness somehow and i sat there frozen
 they don't need me anymore
i'm so wrapped up in my wife that nothing else seems to matter
when i tried last time i remember feeling so calm about everything
 i want to scream the pain is so bad
 i must be fucked up in the head to feel like this constantly
 i was hiking last year and when i got to the peak it was so beautiful
 i used to have purpose and hope
 then you would understand
 things i don't want to speak about to anyone for you all would see me as a monster if i did
 i'm only saying that because he's reading over my shoulder
 and the concept is really weird
 it's something else that is completely stupid because they are so impatient
 i could literally feel something in my brain like a myelene sheathe rip or something
 however
 but when you want to die and commit suicide
 couldn't take care of myself well and did things like come to work late inspite of trying to fight back against him
i have never felt so helpless
 i don't have guys to get a drink with
 everything
how do i get graduate if i cannot even go to class
 i am no longer living
 but while i had been expecting the email today
 and gets mad at me every time i've tried to take them over
mine isn't
obviously
 i really
 and none of it is pleasant
 we have a single income home no pressure there
 worn out and incurable
my supervisor is out to get me
 when we had kids
i hate pain
do i want to survive this easter long weekend or dont i
 maybe it's just an anxiety thing
 i want to si again
 but you cannot tell me that
 also had many ear infections which slowed my speech development
 then boom
 a psychiatrist will not help me
i've had an eating disorder for a while now and whenever i eat i feel like i'm a failure
 i don't do anything right
i can't even put this is words but if there's anyone that feels remotely similar
 my thoughts don't even make sense
 she told me no matter what i'd most likely always be afraid
 but i guess its cathartic to dream of a way out of this mess and a way to escape my thoughts for once
 that's why i built those 'walls'
 so i went there and asked why the fuck they'd give me a referral for an office that doesn't take my insurance
 but i'm okay right now
 i was shocked that after my brain did that great tangent about how wonderful it looks was that the next immediate thought was to just jump off the edge
 there are so many days that go by that i regret not going through with my suicide instead of getting help
i don't know if i really had the delusion that i could be completely over everything one day
 he's gone out to meet these mates of his and i'm terrified he won't come home
 i'm not in danger
 a year and a half later and i'm still struggling with this shit
just
 the thing is
 just keep thinking maybe everyone is better off without me 
 they will all go by and live their lives as if i didn't exist
 i am old
 maybe
 it hurts so bad that it hurts physically
 i told her no
 then i shredded the note and climbed into bed with my man
 i've had things thrown at me and i feel like a failure that
 i'm too crazy for this world
 i am sick of trying
i'm trying - out of habit but i'm trying
i can't stand this anymore
 i gave her everything
 no idea what even from and only 8
 i did the work
 the least i could do is live with being a loser
 i was diagnosed with ptsd
 but i was to cowardly to turn to anyone for help
 my death is as insignificant as that of the tiniest ant
 well i feel just as bad at him yet i am in my senior semester of college and have come the far so i might as well tough it out until may
 and those were my first time i feel so terrified by emptiness
 a weaker person
 that long
 i try to change my situation
 i waited too long
 protesting when the kids ask for some help with something
 even after my suicide
those horrible thoughts are here and i'm so tired of suffering
 it is in an area where it could be years until something in my budget and i am scared to stay in this neighbourhood now as the harassment is almost every day
 that's enough bleating about my problems
 or somewhere
 i try to talk about everything i want to do
raising our kids almost single handedly
 when i'm alone i do nothing but cry and have panic attacks
 there was not a single action i did without considering her feelings
i so wish i were dead
 tomorrow i am going to resign from my job as it's causing me too much stress
 nor will a hospital
 because i am 'functional'
 i was at the cusp of full independence within arms reach of seizing almost everything major i wanted to get out of life
 never could connect with anyone
 i'm sorry that i have failed you all
 so much time and effort
 but yeah
 has turned out to be a lie
 and i've used enough drugs i think my parents would disown me if they knew of my experience in that area
but i haven't talked about it to anyone
 just think about how vast everything is
 never have i had what i would call a real relationship until he came along
 for once in my life saw the night sky while i was sitting alone on top of office building
 especially my loser of a father i had rip but still
 i know it does
 it turned out so ugly though
 what kind of horrible person does that make me
 for the first time i tried to make myself purge and i know it's not pleasant
 i have been suicidal since i was 9 years ago
 today at least is only a dip
being behind the computer screen and researching is nothing like going out there and being poised to do it at that very moment with the very real aspect of failing and going home/being discovered
 and i'll be seen as the kid who tried but couldn't die
 and was rejected
 i don't feel bad for the unfortunate nor do i care about those around me
 this is not an exaggeration
my background is i had no father
 seeing the absolute mess that i have made of my life
 i don't have any more fight in me to continue
 time to go
i'm seeing the doctor tomorrow to see if he can change my meds as the last lot didn't do anything for me
 i think i will go into psychiatric ward
 i love my parents so much and i am only here for them
i'm so stressed out
 no friends
 i have found solace in my depression
i think i'm just too tired to keep going
 dark
 am in no mood to try and figure out medicare
 he has been reading up on abused women and rape survivors and what else i have been through
 but i don't want to
 i won't si because i promised someone i know and care about that i wouldn't
 but she hoped to make me considerably less afraid
 my boyfriend doesn't understand mental illness
 i know the pain suffered by those who are left behind
 it has brought me back to those few times i went out there to do it 
 but in the end
 right now i feel like doing something destructive or hurting myself in some way
 sort of
 i'm not going to get another job
 i can't keep feeling like this
 since i have to do whatever they say
 career is shit
 i do not
 i don't think i am being crazy at all to do this
 thought was stolen so was very stressful
 i'm triggered by being ignored and now i have so many negative and angry thoughts going on through my head
 and i don't have the tools to fix it
 i was ready to walk out the door
 so frustrated
 its like it knows something i don't
 it pains me to feel so poorly about everything and unable to find joy for long periods of time
 no one wants to be with someone like that
 but i spent all this money on equipment
and idk how much longer i can hold on
 i'm worse
 but even with cpap therapy
speaking of work
 i have an awful memory
 i was here first and other people being inpatient decides to blame me because they are inpatient and i'm being patient by following the rules
 we've had bad luck with medical bills and are heavily in debt
 no one would find me
 i'm sorta going blind and my partner seems to not really see that i'm struggling while he has a job
 my dad called me to scrub the toilet and i did
 when is it time to call it
 people i pay charges to for my business have miscalculated the amount
 like this shit has an off switch
 those were my first time i feel so lonely in my own bedroom
 i really can't cope and see no way out
 my kids are young enough that they'll move on
 so it doesn't matter
i really don't think i can ever be normal again without her in my life
 that i had to scrape away at it
 which is not even scary
 because i was alone
 as if they hate me
 it is getting to be a tiring battle that i don't want to take part in anymore
 and the chronic pain had started
why do i struggle over these trivial matters that really don't matter in the grand scheme of things
 nobody will mourn my death
 just to exist a bit longer
 it's all about being picked up and destroyed by others
emotional pain on top of stress from a new job
 they get the authorised version
i have been discouraged since birth
 i am this irresponsible piece of shit
today i woke up feeling like shit and thought about all of the things i hate about myself one of them is my overweight problem so i said to myself you know what
i just don't want to be selfish
 smoked
 my fault
 i'm now receiving therapy & psychotherapy
 behind my knees and down the backs of my lower legs
i've never been a go-getter
 after all
 especially when you try reaching out
here's a little bunny
 i can't breathe and emotionally i need to lay down for the last time
 i can't find a job
 it'll be too easy for me to slowly exit the kids lives
 the main thing keeping me going is moving but if i lose the place
 i just can never find to pick out something i like about myself
 it's also hurts
 i don't neccisarally want to hurt everyone around me except those who have hurt me
 the real me is this
 i did try for four years to get a voiceover career going
 not sure why i am writing this because i feel nothing matters anymore
no one hears
 it's more like i just don't care if everyone has to suffer
 it's so bad that i couldn't even find joy at the birth of any of my 4 kids
 but when i really just needed him to be there for me
 but i am crying right now
 they sick and tired of me
 but because they distract me from the pain
then there's a lack of out-of-marriage relationships
 depressed
 but i know that i no longer have the desire 
 four years ago
 to just be at peace
 i am alone in this world
 i don't care that it won't look like an accident
i have looked for help for several years now
 and now i find that fact hard to deal with
 i'm nothing and the pain of it is eating a hole in me
 i know the temptation to hurt/kill myself while driving is there
 with no kids
 so upset
my mistake was that i planned my whole life around her
i'm not suicidal but i don't want to be here
 or hope i get involved in a road crash
 thank god i didn't succeed
 she thinks this is her fault
i will die sooner rather than later
 i think about killing myself many times a day
i am really scared because i feel like i could easily go over the edge
i'm so unhappy & miserable
 and dealing with the aftermath
 i have diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia for several years ago
 doing what i knew i should have been doing and didnt' it freaked me out
the key i guess is to keep looking if you don't apply at least look
 they put up a tiny temporary sign
 cars
 why did i survive
 feelings do not need logic
 and maybe they'd get a step-dad that can be emotionally present for them instead of this fucked up person they currently have
 can't really pray for death
 i wasn't pushing him to do anything
but before i ever got to talk about that
 in the end
 i don't know when it will overcome me
 i know people say it i stressful but i had no idea how much and that it could all still fall through
 my parents did suggest i stop taking ads after 9 years of doing so
 i've been reading here and elsewhere of people's experiences at the brink of self-destruction when they were brought back from the edge by something
 all this
 and as i near 65 things just keep breaking and hurting more
 there were only people who say that
 on a cv i look like my life is sorted
 but i know for a fact that i will always be jealious and i will always feel that i am missing something inside of me
why can't it just be a diagnosis that can be medicated and let that be it
 so gradually i didn't go as much
 thrown my fetus in the trash and set it on fire
 i tried to scream for help
do you ever feel so useless to people
 i wrote a suicide note last night
but i can't figure out if i want to die or not
 business
 and it's starting to scare me
when really i just feel crushed pretty much every day and pathetic and can't beat the mountain of problems i've created for myself in my life
i just want someone who understands - someone who is not so emotionally involved that every time i talk about [self-mutilation] they cry and refuse to think rationally
 then the first thoughts of suicide appeared
 my whole body is just effing revolting
 i wanted to do voices in cartoons
i want to talk about the way i'm feeling again but i can't even tell people i tried in february because i'm scared it will push my friends and family away
 it hurts every single day and it's just not worth it anymore
sometimes i feel like i am not going to get another job because i'm 55 yet i do continue to try
 pregnancy scares
 i'm not interesting
i wouldn't have to face my parents again
 i just feel the only way to end this is to end my life
 cutting and even contemplating death
 if i only had a physical disease and we could all get together and say goodbye
 and that i failed you all
 i am here as i have nobody to talk to at all
 i feel like i was always destined to be this piece of shit
but i am a little scared if it doesn't kill me
 i dont want to take another breath
 it all needs to stop
 my hemoglobin went down again last month to 9
 but i don't know how to face the world without my husband
i really feel that it's time for me to actually do it
 suicidal thoughts seem logical to me
 i was all alone
 not this time
 either way i can't take this suffocating loneliness anymore
 which means i'll lose my house
i can't leave my house anymore without strangers being so rude to me
 i know they wanted it to since they have starved me for the whole day
 but i long for it
 but i feel like others would be ultimately better off
 i want to crawl in that coffin with him and just die
 i'm just physically and mentally worn out by the physical pain
i want to silence what is around me because i can not silence my mind
 i have a long pattern of losing friends
 i'm scared to walk out in public because i hate the way i look
 and there's no use trying - i haven't been able to get on the internet until now i live in china
i feel like a failure all the nights i've been up
 couldn't sleep because of pain and my damn feet were hot
 or karma
 i'm afraid i could not stop myself as yesterday
anyone who has ever been this depressed
 but none of them care
 and very unpleasant
 i am constantly fighting like this
 if you take away the emotion you wouldn't want someone in so much pain to have to continue
 i hate my life
 i have failed more than i ever dreamed possible
 it's sad
 i can't think of any reasons not to do it
my therapist has instructed me to think of the logic side as a parental figure that needs to hug the emotional side
 but i am considering it now
 i wish i was
but when i realize
 how these something or someone made these blinds in front of me
 but whenever i don't eat i feel like i'm letting down my friends when they tell me i should eat
 i am not mean
 but i also don't want to give him up
 i have no friends for many years and this is causing big anxiety living alone and i have no future
 didn't have the courage to even do that
 recently
 or if they did come i told them i was in there for a different reason
 so much time that i have spent for her
 but i don't feel normal at all
 i've been in therapy and made progress in some things
 then a bailiff turned up at my door
 it's happened so many times 
 my suicidal thoughts crept back in
 i'm always home alone
 i want to be completely devoid of emotion
 but they are coming much less frequently than they once did
 i can't work as things are right now
 now i'm thinking i'm being ignored on here as well
 i hate how disorganized this professor is
 i fear the time where the pain overrides the guilt is coming soon and i try for that 'accidental' death
 yet i stayed
 nothing to live for
 but life just doesn't work out like you want it to
 but fml
 i'd love to understand why people think suicide is bad
 but no action
 i need someone to talk to because i've reached my limit
i feel sick
 switched office supplies so i assembled the mailers incorrectly
 i have no morality anymore
 and hardly even thought about making it to graduating high school since i was so caught up in wanting to just die
only makes me wake up all angry
 i have a phobia of silence
but i'm truly serious about this suicide attempt and when it gets to the day - will i pull through or give in
 am so worried about her and terrified of losing her
 and he's already got two daughters he adopted both grown now and out of the house he doesn't want to start over
 but if i don't sh i feel like i'm too wimpy and too much of a failure to do anything
i realize i am not like any one else
 she had beat me on a regular basis
 this is something i cannot deal with
 growing on the train
 i spend my days helping to sue people who were stupid enough to spend thousands of dollars on a vacuum
 the way i feel now is very scary
 for attention
 i can't live with this anymore
 i spent so much money on our happiness
 i'm trying very hard to pay no mind to the little voices but when i am losing hope its that much harder
 i swear
 it is difficult
 rather than got the work
 or offer me any form of real advice beyond 'well that will damage your health'
 just done
 so long
 but glad i got some of it out
 i just don't know how to go about it
 i'm too far gone
 i really do
 i know he cares and he wants to be there
 i won't cut ties with them
 i have tried every possible option including ect and many experimental treatments
i feel invisible and worthless
i was just out to get my daughter her shots and needed to fill my van with gas
 and the others are random disturbing scary dreams 
 it's making me confused about things that really happened and nightmares 
 since then it feels like things are snowballing
i know i've hardly been on this site anymore
 i don't like saying sappy or sad things in general either
 but it would not go easily
 really
 ended up breaking you
 i drank
 kiss her on the cheek and give her a hug
 ummmm
 but
 looking to past mistakes that dictate my current state and my future
 not even my worst enemies
 sadly since he died the fandom got a bit strange and so many things changed
 earlier i said i don't want people to hurt i just don't care if they do
 there have been times in my life when i've seen glimmers of hope
 suicide seems so romantic to me
 continuously rejected and treated like inferior garbage by women
 i've worked hard and i know my future might have nice avenues
 right now i'm twelve hours away from them
 i've held down jobs
 and i think this and then think how pitiful and pathetic that thought is
a few years ago
my back hurts
 that is why i keep getting the thoughts of ending it all
 the reason i feel trapped is i can't end my life due to the hurt i would cause my children and wife
no matter what i do i feel like a failure
 i've worked in the mental health field
 my 'diagnosis' is something along the lines of unspecified disturbance of the personality structure if i translate it directly
 i came off ads thinking i didn't need them anymore
my logic brain wants me to live
 the acceptable one
 i wasn't ready to give the order to take him off the only medication forcing his heart to pump
no one else i can talk to - too afraid - no one i can trust
 i have fought for help
 i've also graduated high school
 i can't remember ever felling any positive emotions such as love or joy
 tried to methods> 
 i just dont know what to do anymore
 and i feel like a shit dad and a worse husband
 ashamed
i'm having suicidal thoughts right now
 but i like the feeling
 i haven't been on a fan board in so
 she said that thing again she has said so many times
 i just coasted and collected my paycheck
why should i even live
 i just want someone to relate to this
 the more i want to die
 the pain relief i take are not nearly enough to help me
i have learned to live with this
 how can anyone hurt a child
 whatever
 my mother wanted to kill me
 i'm not sure if it's a bad thing but it's just how i feel
wish i had some support
 i wasn't successful but now i wish i was
 my hope is that if someone goes through my internet history they'll come across this post and get a brief inkling of how unhappy i feel
 i have no money
 i'm not even frightened anymore i just don't have the strenght to heal my heart again
 i guess
 i'm no use when it comes to helping her with the physical work i used to do around the house and garden
 i thought about it
 i really have no alternative but to expire; but like i said i'm scared to do that
who does that
 which i have lost interest in wanting to be in a relationship even though there is pressure from many people for me to be in one
 my wife suffers from pnes and can't work because of the seizures
 i now work outside of mental health as i thought that may help me get away from these negative thoughts
 i have to walk today and i am scared
this whole situation has completely knocked the life out of me
 wrong
i tried to commit suicide in late february <mod edit> 
 since they break site rules
i am sorry if this is against the rules
 why
 i don't have anything to live for
 i am in my forties
 which exacerbates the depression
lately school has been giving me anxiety
 not one person is there to care for me
 because its not like being dead won't mess up everything anymore than getting help will
 someone else will kiss her and do all the things we did or would do
the best way i can put how i feel is that i'm sorry for living
 but i despise their mother
 just like me
long story short i had a meltdown
 it is too painful to wake up every day with nothing to do but try not to think suicidal thoughts
 right now my eyes hurt so much
i told my mom i am unable to work yet she still nudges suggestions my way
 goddamn i wish i could die
a friend of mine posted a meme the other day and tagged me
 and nothing is helping
 the thing is i'm not scared
 i feel it is time to go
 it's just not enough
 because i could never hurt them
 suddenly i got stuck being fixated on the bad
just wish my mind would stop thinking of ending my life every time i get into an argument with someone even strangers or someone tells me if i'm doing something wrong
 i never pin that to my feelings of killing myself
 i felt like i was agreeing
 i thought of a thousand ways to kill me
 or i care
 but it's not the same since he died
 but only in my own eyes
today was hard
 i so hate being me
 i looked down and <mod edit methods /details> luckily
 i am everything i aways felt i was
 i don't understand why i'm here and it'd just be easier for everyone if i wasn't
 or myself either to be honest
 i feel like pushing everyone away right now
 i'm so tired and feel so isolated
 like sometimes i try to remember yesterday and wonder did this really happen or was it a nightmare i can't tell the difference and i'm freaking out
 but things can be going well
i feel like all my friends are so far ahead of me
 there's a long list of other things but i don't want to bore anyone
 life has been so crazy recently
 i tried to save him
 i wish i was dead
 does anyone know what will happen if i tell somebody about this
 my brother were taken away by child welfare and both are in prison
 it's just the lying
 i've just sat alone and cried and soaked up every negative thing anyone has said or done to me and let it eat me alive
 i'm sorry but i can't get the feeling out of my system the minute i started gagging
 i refuse to go on meds
i was home alone that night
 make all of those feelings go away and feel absolutely nothing
 and i feel incapable of coping with these disappointments
 so i could be free from myself
it hurts
 i didn't really think these things
 there are so many other people who have urgent situations that could use some kind of help but i'm just here because i've wracked my brain and run out of options in my mind 
begining to end
 but lately i'm sure that i can't make it
everyone here is too busy for me
 i hate them
 i knew i couldn't live like that
 the lies and blame she laid on me over the next few months was staggering
 that she was meant to be the one to me
 my asthma is barely controlled
 in fact
 she was the only person that mattered in my life
 it made me realize how much my upbringing has affected my mental health and these past six months have been particularly difficult
 all day i keep thinking about how i don't want to be alive and that i wish i could just die
 i am ignored or saying i haven't given it enough time to kick in
 brought me back to my senses
 all seems to be going down hill
 wish i methods>
 pushover me which she admits is a trait that attracter her to me gave in and at 3 months into our relationship she was pregnant
 all unrelated
 i feel trapped sometimes and alone
 i was actually starting to think that i might have a future with less pain
 and a lot of problems revolve around them
 she ended up pregnant again even though we always used condoms
 none of this was my fault
 not even my parents or siblings
 i get it
 i don't want to get better
 this year i am meant to be moving house
 but as i got older
 eventually i cheated
 then within a month and a half everything was taken from me
 i would have hundreds saying to go through with it and just end it
 tried to find a reason why i am extremely alienated
 i have never cut myself before
 it is now barely noticeable
i didn't choose this i don't know why i have to be the person i am i'm an idiot i didn't choose to be born as someone i'm disappointed in
 it hurts it hurts it hurts
 if i die in my apartment
 it brings back so many horrible memories of when i used to be ignored
no one sees the fake smile
 the only thing that keeps me from doing it is the obligation i have to these 4 kids
i'm tied of nobody ever wanting anything to do with me unless i can help them or going to an appointment
i'm tied
i have severe medical conditions/injuries that have left me in constant pain
 i didnt want to
 completed half of my undergraduate degree a year early while on a path to a masters degree
 i'm supposed to be a finishing senior but i've retaken a few classes so i'm a junior in terms of credits
 i have no desire to go anywhere or get up out of this bed
 when she showed the first signs of wanting to break it all up
 i literally do not have any friends at all
 but to no avail
 he told me that if i wanted to talk
 what did i do to deserve such misfortunes
not sure why but every time i'm in an argument with someone or someone points out something i'm doing wrong
 it starts with these serene tunes as man in the mirror starts playing
 i find no joy in anything and i keep thinking it would be such a good idea to just take my own life
 an invisible man
i want to start out saying i am sorry to hear about everyones problems and struggles
i actually stared at a <mod edit
 but i've shut all doors and can't handle atm
 and i really didn't have any place to go as i have no friends and family is in no position to take me on
 month or so really and to suddenly feel beyond crippled again is just so damn hard to deal with
 i got someone to understand
it helped a bit to cry today
 i know that my selfish reasons for wanting to continue to be here
 i will die
 why do i have to create an excuse to get out of it
 i sealed that world away from me
 there's more but it's too hurtful to go into
 tell them that they understand and validate these emotions
 i've been nearly shoved down a flight of stairs
 just bad enough to push me over the edge
 i am just waiting for the details on legalized euthanasia to be worked out here in canada and then i will apply for it
 i was never really comfortable at family gatherings
 its hard to ignore the pain
 maybe i'm becoming who i was destin to become
 he expects me to just 'be okay'
 i just don't care what happens to anyone around me anymore
i tried suicide several times
 i'm haunted by so many memories of so much abuse
last night
 i can't remember when i last felt worthy to
 clearly it didn't work
i want to know if anyone can even relate to this i don't know what kind of reply i'm looking for--if any at all
 i haven't had a day where i was happy
 she's not a bad mother to the kids
 i am just existing
 yet i don't think i am ready to die
 i think i do have everything i need if i really wanted to make that choice
 what do you think i been doing
 i thought that if i had a distraction
 just rather disappear
 i did it to make myself feel better
 for a few days i've felt lethargic and down and i want relief
my dad has been depressed and anxious all his life
wish me luck guys
but i just cant help but wonder how the f$# my brain heals itself with this crap
 i put away the methods
 but it's not
 just been thinking everyone is better off without me
 there is nobody who love me
 diagnosed with mild sleep apnea
no income
 i would have just been locked up sooner
 finances
 maybe because i may be of no use and no matter what i try
 i felt like the lie has drained out of me
i was so stressed i was eating right
 this past week has been the worst of my life
 also i'd rather have them feel constant pain throughout their lives until they hate it just as much as i do
i know there is no myelene sheath in the brain
 i wanna close my eyes and never wake up again
most answers and advice i get just feel like random phrases thrown at me
 but i know i am
 so i've had to go over to his house which at first he is annoyed by but then seems grateful for and back to his normal self
 i know i am not going to do anything and i don't want to but the thought is there and it hurts so badly
 the worse it gets
some time ago i was told i may have cancer and that i should get some tests
 staring at the screen
 my mind won't let me
 i need help
depression destroyed my relationship i'm going to kill myself method request>
 i had to get this out because i can't talk to my wife because she will go into seizures because of the anxiety this would cause
 but i know it's a shitty idea
 i'm getting back to making dinner
 stopping them three months ago only to now contract two horrible diseases
 it makes me sad to know that i nearly always feel this way
 i feel like i'm bothering them or i can't fight my own battles because i'm too weak
 my inner pain is just growing and growing without relief and i know that she would be better off without me now
 done being disappointed
 during the 'happier' times i never feel at peace and there is always my depression shadow lurking over my shoulder just waiting for a trigger
 i gave everything to that person
 by that time i was broken
 i've lost someone important to me to suicide before i can't let it happen again
i felt like this at new year's then on the 5th of january one of my kitties suddenly died
 i know it's selfish but like i said it's just a thought
 years of battling this disease has not made me any better
i think i'm too much of a coward to actually do anything
it just feels like some really
 my story isn't all that bad
 as i have never attended college and had to withdraw from my studies due to being severely bullied
 i've declared for the last time that i've lost my battle with depression
today i was talking to a friend of mine online
 i currently go to class and i know school/university shootings are thought of as a terrible thing
 i caved to stop the constant pressure and nagging
 if i were to die today or tomorrow it wouldn't bother me the slightest
 i don't want to be a husband or a father
 i am lonely i chose work over friends
 gay or neither
i have my suicide planned out - i have almost everything ready down to the date and time and method
 but it just makes me feel crappy for all my personality traits
 stupid things like the parcel man has left a parcel at the shop where i got assaulted
 i wonder how's it like to be numb from everything
 my brain wouldn't allow me to
 it's severe nerve pain in my hips
 well the current state of my medications have not been working for along time now and when i ask for a review or a change
 so i took a trip out of state to see my mom who i'm not really all that close to
how long will this last
 my kitties are my reasons to live and is like losing a child to me
 to worse
i had planned on asking her if she thought i was borderline or something like that
 i don't really visit this site as much as i use to when i really needed to talk as i felt bad that i am trying to help people
feel free to correct me if it isn't
 but because of my mental state
i used to belong here
 receiving little or none
 i don't have friends because i don't allow anyone to know the real me
 but my boss actually wanted me to stay
 i am looking for support groups in my area so i can feel less alone about having these negative feelings
 so that i won't drowned in there
 but i know she had done those things
 i live a waking hell and wish my life on no one
 i'm so ashamed of myself for not being positive enough or not doing the best i can as far as college and my part-time job go
 then
 which makes me feel even more low
maybe i'm just expecting him to say it
 during the time of trying to get the services i had a few troubles with attempts at suicide
 they come randomly sometimes in the day or when i have depressed bouts
they were showing the movie 'moonwalker' that evening
 really happen
btw i can't go back on them because i'm participating in a clinical trial and i have to be clean for that another two months besides
 i've been freezing all yesterday
 surely no-one is expected to live with pain like this
 i'm very scared to do this
 my duty to these kids keep me from doing it
 but pussy doormat me caved to her pleas for forgiveness and stayed
abruptly the typical sounds of dawn seep into my room
 told him what was happening and we cried for a few hours before falling asleep
 and parties aren't meant to last
 all that i am wish now for it all to be over
 am on meds for clinical depression and just feel very lost
 i didn't actually fall
 but was stopped by my brother
 just rather be gone so i don't make things worse
 they will think - she was one of the real sufferers
i stupidly tried to end it all on thursday night
 and as for those who have hurt me i want to cause an unfathomable amount of pain to
 but at least the damage is stayed and maybe things become easier for them
 so exhausted
i'm finally ready to die
 therefore
 i feel like i lost the most important person in the world to me and it is eating me up inside
 there has been no progress
 by leaving now
 as far as my own life i don't care much about that either
i feel worthless
 the sleep apnea and diabetes aren't enough
 where i used to live everyone has forgotten about me or doesn't have the time to talk
 the truth is i just don't care
i want to drive somewhere and get away
 meditate
 i've really gotten low since i started seeing her in feb
i'm going to immediately give my rebuttals to some of the posts i will immediately get
 i also went to college to get away from crap jobs now that i had a family
 i try to ignore them and it just makes them higher
 therapists
but due to this trigger i'm very depressed
 and that i just needed someone to care
 that there's no overcoming the past
 the worst part about this is that my mother works at the same company and wants me to work there with her but when i try to explain
 then i don't have to feel the pain anymore
 the thought i should get a divorce crossed my mind many times
 i took a shower and been having more thoughts
 i'm trapped in this pain and misery
 this would strain our already bankruptcy level of debt
 can't concentrate on anything
 tired of living and tired of fighting and always losing and failing
 worthless
 nothing would change bc i don't have a problem with being a terrible person why would i
i don't want to be diagnosed with anything
 i know he can find someone better
 this is hard to type because i'm fearful of being scrutinized but i've had to stop therapy and i'm concerned for my well being
 i want out
 not the same amount that was inflicted upon me
 i joke a lot about suicide and other terrible things to those around me and some believe i'm just joking and others wonder how i could say such terrible things
every single day
 couldn't find anything
 cheating and manipulation she has done to me
 my car
 but to me
 i've been sent to inpatient treatment for an eating disorder
 is this the day it can end
last night i came very close to being done
 i am not much to ask any one for help
 how did you get out of it
 building his carreer
 what will people think of me
 i don't know how to put into words what i actually feel it's complicated but it's also really minimal it's not a deep feeling it's just hard to describe
 it occurred to me yesterday
 way too much
 i feel like such a horrible mother
 and didn't want to feel alone anymore
what keeps me going
 pressed against me
 there was no funeral
 i just dont
 nothing is bringing me out of this deep dark well in which i now lurk
 i think i'm a masochist based on past choices and that i sabotage myself because i just can't help myself
 existing
not a day goes by where i don't think about taking my life
 i am not sure how much i am comfortable with writing down but i will try to at least get some basics
 i wouldn't feel bad for those who lost their lives and those who lost their loved ones
want to die
 and i can't recover from them financially or emotionally
 no relationship
 i am isolated
 but i stayed for the money
 and every move i make just fucks up my life even more
 in bed
 please
 where i could feel love
 i have been pretty active for the last few weeks
 maybe it will make me feel like i can feel something again
 and another car cuts in front of me and an impatient man behond who gets out of his car just to tell me off to get my vehicle out of the way afyer i just finished filling up
 walking around not really knowing where i am going or what i am doing
 i wouldn't worry about being isolated and being a waste of life
 thrown here and there patched back up by well meaning therapists
 my bank account is dwindling down to nothing since i've been unemployed for so long and the longer i'm unemployed the harder it will be to find a job
 nope
 im constantly improving myself
 i dont wanna die i just want this pain to go away and idk how much longer i can deal with it
 got routine bloodwork monthly and my hemoglobin rose a point but i am still slightly anemic
 i tried to fight it
 i been so angry
 sit next to me
 i just want to be taken seriously
 today i feel that bad feeling yesterday back
my moods are up and down
 i also create those 'worlds' where i could feel everything i want
 she said she did it because she loved me so much that she wanted a family with me
 i could drive home but the sight of my dad deteriorating on that couch just triggers me to be even more depressed
the pain is so intense right now
 i've considered terrible things today
 there is only one cure for me
 i literally lay in my room all day and live off saltines because i don't want to leave my room to cook
started building since i got up
 she diagnosed me with double depression dysthymia and mdd
 but whenever i mention feeling suicidal nobody thinks i will actually go through with it
 and absolutely nothing my name
 i have little to add of value
 i am trying to distract myself
 it'll only make it worse as i've read elsewhere
 which hold mine tightly before
 i'll miss so much school
it's just all so overwhelming and stressful to have to hear their aches and pains and fight over their own sadness when i'm sad too
 being done worrying
 i just want to go
 the joys of knowing you messed up again
 if i died today nobody would care
 have no reason to be here
 5 other kitty illnesses
 yet i'm afraid to know them further
 than to top if off i got ignored by my family tonight and that just topped the cake
 and i followed suit
 the emptiness
 i have a couple of friends but you know how it is not the same
 exhausted
 hating it
 my mother is bipolar and has become severely depressed these last few years
 i have never had that and probably never will
 i can't get work because of the nature of my crime and i can't qualify for government assistance
 i had the tv on
 and even if i came to the conclusion that i was a bad person bc of this
i don't know what i want to do
 letting myself drowning again after i sealed my source of safety away
i take long baths as my mind races against time
 because that is something god would not approve of
 she does not feel any passion anymore and she is tired
 friendships
 the pain is unbearable
 i'm just existing and i don't want to exist anymore
 i feel horrible for my scars from si
 i got dealt a terrible hand in this life and i always tried to make the most of it
last year i got seperated from my friends because my grades were too low
 the more i show pain the less they care
 without doubt i am depressed but i think it's worse then that
 i failed
 and can't even pay all of our bills
 like working at her place or another collection agency
 i should be in control of my own decisions & outcomes
i just don't want to be here
 or perform
 if i am going to try
 there is nobody who cares about me
 if you decided to not read my rant i don't blame you
 and i feel too much
 over and over again
 when everyone looks at you but no one sees you
 my digestive system is shot
all the time
 more feeling empty
being a loser in life sucks and makes me extermely suicidal
 don't amount to anything
 when i was very mentally unstable
 and i can handle a lot of stress
but it was short-lived
 i can't shift it
i've had humiliating rumours spread about me
 but the last few days have really taken there toll on me
 they didn't ask to be born to me
i've been to many doctors over the past 4 months
 it's not right and i need to stop
 so very very tired
if it's not something where i'm not parenting my kids right in the strangers mind
 but i seem to have hit a wall and sometimes it still feels like killing myself is the only option i have anymore
my latest thought is that i would have to literally move to the other side of the country to try to forget her as being where i am just constantly reminds me of her
 my mother talked right over me and yet again i feel like i don't matter to my family
 now all i can see is <insert graphic image of my suicide here>
 my crime stims from childhood and if i would have seeked helped about it
and my mom was into prostitution
i can't say the thoughts that are in my head - against the rules here - i understand why but it means they stay locked there
 and everything was on the table in front of me
 why would i lose my job
 so maybe it's not all me
 i've become a bad husband in a damaged marriage
 i also have the symptoms of borderline personality disorder
but then again
 i have no one to talk to and please dont pretend to care and say can i talk to you
as the credits rolled i found out i was smiling
 i can't do anything
 when pain outweighs suffering it's time
 i've attempted suicide twice
 there is no rhyme or reason to it
i just worry myself
 but i just couldn't shake the feelings that there's a huge wall between us now
 this is darkness that i can't escape from
 i was so happy just three months ago but then i thought
second time i left a message for them to get back to me but i fell asleep before they called back when they did my husband told them i was sleeping 
 he's moody right now and down which i understand
 my mind does not want to get better
 but i genuinely just want it to be all over
 over friendships that have changed so much
 i feel like i don't matter
 i just don't know what to do this time
 i apologized profusely this morning but this afternoon i locked myself in a room and started
 i'm confused about myself and what i'm doing and i don't want to keep going on because i feel like i can't do anything right and i feel like i'm wasting the time of everyone associated with me
 horrible nightmares
 if i violated anything i am sorry
 if anyone needs to talk i'm here so you know you're not alone
 i know my time is running out but while i'm in an okay place i don't want tiger to end it early
 however i am still really tired everyday
 i should not be here
 i react to it by abusing drugs and cutting
 but for me it's not
 i would never put them through that
 and that right now is too much for me to handle
 have not been back since and now have to go knowing the man is always there at the cafe and then kids kicked a football hitting my shoulder while carrying sick kitty in a box
 i'm tired of failing
for a moment today
 at this moment
 and then there would be humungous police business and stuff being in the spotlight
 an empty shell who hates life
 my parents should've aborted me
and i have no education or goals
there really isn't anything keeping me here
 afraid
 i was an unpaid intern with a month left to go
 but some asshole had to become jealous
 i don't have the urge
 i can't concentrate enough to work on my writing
 he basically told me that he didn't care
 i just was switched off and taking a trip down memory lane by myself in a dark room <mod edit>
 i cheated on my wife and hurt her
 insurance broker at work does not answer my emails
 my anxiety is through the roof
 last night i spent a lot of time looking into methods again
 helped volunteer
 so they still have not sorted it or told the people who collect the money so now have to try to sort that
this failure is the last drop in a glass already too full
i'm sick of needing to ask for help and support
 i feel like i no longer have a heart
 i'm just sick of this
 i'm trapped inside my head and it's giving me a panic attack that i can't shut my thoughts off when i need to function today
 to put it in a scenario
 it sucks to put it mildly
 would do things to taunt me
 it hurts so bad
 i just want this pain to go away
 i know that the pain i feel is temporary right now
 to nothing at all
 apparently that's what they call when i've been harming myself since i was 5
 i was so offended i went elsewhere
 i knew that i had to change something
 i put on a fake smile
that's why i hate living
 they tell me i'm really skinny but i just don't see it
 exist
 but today they bother me
i'm leaning to ward the second option
 glad i'm home but just drained in life
 it's cold
 on how to deal with the constant drain being in constant pain causes
i'm not sure what else to do now
 at the rate i am going
 my eldest
 i hate how it takes me ages to make a friend and even then they do more talking than me i hate how i compare myself to others and think how much of a mistake i am
but yeah
 can't do anything about this until i get the kids to school
 i have no qualms about the morality of suicide
 i don't really enjoy doing anything anymore
 nothing in my life seems to have changed
 i still can't seem enjoy anything or feel happiness
 on top of everything i was heavily bullied in school and my mum was abusive
 he would talk about me in round about tones that it made me paranoid
 so what the hell is wrong with me
 you get beat down you get back up
another thing that stops me going through with this is that i keep hoping to have some kind of 'experience'
 the thought of hurting myself became more apparent
 yesterday i woke up with a person on the phone and she asked me to stay
 nothing like that
 or sad or even somewhat happy
 i hate living
 afraid that i would get hurt later
the torment is so much
 i been sitting here thinking about writing a suicide note
 i tried to get the brain operation for deep brain stimulation but the clinical trial has been cancelled
 all i can say is that i am one ****ed up individual who does a lot of things they shouldn't
 so ill just start and you can try it for yourself
 without even realizing
 he died 4 times in front of me
recently i did several real prison tests based on psychopath testing
 i think this earth is so cool
 but it's where i am
i actually went to work today for the first time in 3 weeks
 in time i grew away from sf for my own wellbeing
 yesterday i wanted to die
 i have no idea
 i don't like talking to people about things like this
 pills didn't help
 but i think it is the depression too
i even have a tattoo dedicated to him
 why did the world have to be so cruel to me
i'm done
 i had a major breakdown
 he's brain damaged after an accident he had as a teen
i dont know if i ever put my whole story down
 but the thought of leaving breaks my heart
 hated by everyone
 i wasn't ready to lay on his chest as i always did but it not move
 and i feel like i didn't even blink
 since i have no passion or drive to excel
 to make it tougher
 i'm being paranoid and i should start loving myself and work on my thought process a little better
 all three years went to dump
i wish i could find a person similar to relate to because getting help is very hard to do
 so that i don't have to care about nobody being there for me or for my funeral
 he even told me we need help
there are many times where i wanted to commit suicide
 i thought to myself recently
i realize this is all said in my dark thoughts
 everything i am doing is worthless
 being fearful of pending doom
 i used to be very active here
 i almost feel like i hate myself for being like this
 they just stop caring about your pain
 the handyman job that supported me through college went out of business and now the internship which offered me a job was my last hope
 isn't that enough of a reason to do the right thing
 i made a thread on here and didn't get any responses
 i have suffered visual-snow for the last 3-4 years but progressed badly the last month because i drank some vodka with my brother and his friends and girlfriend
i was wrong
 i wouldn't do that
 i just got off on a tangent but i am feeling crazy right now stuck in my thoughts with no one to talk to
 i don't know what else to do
i want to talk about it to someone because i've been thinking about doing it again
 i scream
 i don't laugh
i feel trapped on all sides
 i want to die
 that was also one of the times i had a very serious suicide attempt planned
 had an abusive father and an alcoholic mother and i was always unattractive to women because of my unattractive face
 what is the point
 and online services and it wasn't worth it
my apathy and lack of care is concerning me
from here on out things will only get worse the older i get so i see no point in continuing to drag myself through this living hell
 i asked the physician who suggested i get tested
 how to feel about it
 i had hoped to be dead long ago
 each day for me is difficult because when i try to get help i feel like people are paid to help me or studying me
 i can't handle this
 i need certainty
 i am finally trying to fix it
 i cut myself off in thought with i want to kill myself
 i hate being this way
 it's been awhile since i had thoughts
 not even sure of the true reason though
 i do not necessarily make amends to those around me who i have harmed
 i am going to develop another substance abuse problem
i don't want to and can't go on like this anymore
 to their sport games and practices and out to the store when they beg to go with me
 not being able to sleep
 i still haven't learned i recently showed a glimpse of this battered useless life preserver to someone and i fear that once again i am to be betrayed
 my two bestfriends hardly speak to me and never give me the help i need
 reading the same pages while in my mind i've been justifying why i can't go
 more hysteric crying
my dad is chronically ill and i'm one of the main caretakers
 what is the point of suffering like this
 i tried that already and all i got was a lot of pain
 and realized how this nightmare is pretty much my life thus far
 the marketplace
 i had an argument with my mother
 so many ideas that i worked out
 but i am tired of emptiness and pain
 i just want to sleep peacefully and being numb forever
 hollow
 traumatic big things mixed with lots of little things are making me feel like i am hanging on by a thread and just waiting for the next thing to fuck me over
 mum would have dragged me there by my hair if i tried to refuse
 my death is extremely insignificant
 suicide crossed my mind but couldn't go further with it since i'm pregnant
 please just let me die please
 and wishing i wasn't me
 i don't know the other students in my clinic
 no one cares
 sad
i am sick of fighting
i am new here and just needed somewhere to write my feelings where i wouldn't be judged
so here i am again
 its so scary and every time i wake up after a nightmare i wake up feeling like shit and panicking and tired like i didn't even sleep or rest 
 i hate school
 as for those who aren't close to me i wouldn't have even the slightest care for
 why be here if i keep messing up
 no friends and no family
 and this trigger could be absolutely anything
 the trouble is if i ended my life
 my life just seems so
 everything is gone
why can't this stop
 today the nightmare was that he came to beat the shit out of me and rape me and i couldn't do anything to stop it then the worse part he went to rape my mom and i still couldn't protect her 
i am tired of trying things over and over
 i was ready to wait patiently for him to die for the final time
i understand it is difficult being with someone with mental illness
 immediate self preservation becomes justification for slow
 these make any small task feel huge in size and tire me out rather fast while trying to seem happy and hide behind my mask i put up to not show my true self
 the more i type the more i panic because i realize how debilitated and pathetic my life has become
i guess i'm at that point of no return
why is it that i can't seem to escape these thoughts going through my head
 been on the same medications for over a year now
 i should live
 i barely even considered what i was doing
 and i'm fighting with myself so much right now
this morning
 causes too much pain in digestive tract
 but the worse it got
nope
 i'm so scared
 i am also on government disability money
 and have very few connections
 i came back
 i want to be with him anyway possible
i feel like shit everyday
 why can't i just stop
i want to get help because of my suicidal thoughts
i now feel optimistic to get myself sorted
 i would like to wait until my parents leave this world first
 my ex used to be one of the most supportive people and now he doesn't even answer a text message from me
 i now get hidrenitis to accompany it all
 my body
 i couldn't wiggle myself out of it
 after a nasty phase of excessive partying and doing drugs
 i've been dealing with my depression & anxiety for as long as i can remember
 i don't like drinking really
 yet for some reason my brain tries to
 i feel like i would rather die than deal with facing any of it
i barely know what loneliness is
i do not know if i will commit suicide or if i will simply let my mind and body decay until i just die
 i try endlessly to block these thoughts out
 but at that very moment
 i'm empty and hopeless
 i was locked up for almost 3 years
 especially when i'm asked to show them my arms
i told people not to visit me in hospital
 i grieved his death so badly
 i'd never feel that before
 i almost feel as though i am dead inside
i hope this doesn't break rules
 most of the nightmares are about the fucker who raped me 
 because i was afraid i'd not find better
 i hate being how i been
i can get to thinking that i need to improve myself and let her see i'm strong & confident so she finds me hopefully attractive again
 nothing goes right and never has
 i just don't know when
 it's like i'm making a mountain out of a molehill
i'm trying to find reasons to hold on and to keep going but i'm coming up blank
 i am essentially a diseased mutt waiting for the day when he will be put down
 that i was too unhealthy to work i also have interstitial cystitis as well as depression and anxiety
 i feel so invisible
 to go to a therapist
 but i have to
 i've had things put in my hair
 i don't expect him to
 during this time my wife started pressuring me for another kid
 waiting for this benadryl to kick in so i can sleep
 he has nobody to turn to and is ignored no matter what he does he has been to many therapists and nothing worked
 and he told me i was 'amazing' for even trusting him enough to want to meet him
that's why i tried to reach out for help
 inside i feel nothing but agony
 i am trying to finish up this one last semester for school but i might not even have the money
 i have no disposable income to even try to do thinks i might enjoy
 they don't deserve an absent father
 he is socially isolated since birth by everyone
 and ending a life other than my own isn't something i am interested in
i tried hard to understand what is wrong with me and why no one likes me
 i haven't been the real me for 9 years
 will i always have to look over my shoulder even in broad daylight just in case someone would hurt me
whenever i sh i feel free and i get a sensation that makes me feel human but i feel like i've failed everyone
 instead of building relationships & networking much like my lack of friends i rode my bosses coattails
 the reason i am able to enter this help site is because i have hid my laptop and phone and wallet under my pillow all the time
almost broke down ordering a fucking breakfast from the deli
 i still felt isolated and it wasn't because of me
 i will never forgive my parents for bringing me into this world
i cannot bear this existence any longer
 i have been chain smoking cigarettes and it is making my chest burn
i thought about this for a while
 and have come to ask what is the point
 and already takes anti-depression tablets
 there is nothing in this world worth dragging myself through the day for
 not once
not even my cats are working ones been super affectionate today but i just can feel it
 the men here have no respect for women
 then after i spend all my money on that i still won't have a guaranteed job
 but no one i know understand how i am feeling and they cannot help me
 i feel inept in parenting and work
 but i've been clean for around a month or more
 i feel i'm running out of time to hold on - it's just slipping through my fingers as my pain and despair deepens
 i spend all day in my bedroom thinking about how if i didn't have my children i wouldn't have to be here anymore
 i want these things and don't want to give them up for good
 sometimes it's very hard to be able to cry
 he has attempted suicide many times and suffers severe depression like me
 i know i am trying to sleep so i can get up early and chat with my ldr boyfriend
i also feel like not trying
 we have to write down and post 5 positive things about ourselves or things that happened to us during that day
however i know one thing
other members will know who needs extra support today
nothing is worth it everything is so pointless
 i've already decided how and when i want to leave
 unbeknownst to him
 am i ashamed
 he's talking about someone who cares not someone who gets paid
 i attempt to give them the father they deserve
 hope that i could function in this world
 tired
 how my 'wrong' behavior makes sense because of how i was brought up
 about my depression
 it's the outline of a black heart on my wrist
 if i die then people will know
 but time after time things remind me these are unachievable dreams
 i am sorry i could not be helped
 we are trying to get her on social security but she has no income either
 pussy doormat me always caves
 isn't that a good enough excuse for going along with the screams of every cell within me that just wants to finally give up
 none of this is their fault
 sure that may make me a bad person but so what
 i was being so careful
 never to return
i want so badly to just end it all
 it just got worse everyday
 i'm still so suicidal
 it wouldn't hurt anyone
 i couldn't concerntrate
 and have realized many times over i should leave sound familiar
another thing i cannot deal with is the fact that i have to realize
no one gives a damn
 extreme bullying growing up
 pick her up
when i cry i feel like a failure because i can't just hold it in any longer
 i am chicken to off myself
 or at least not badly and i allow myself to look at the future and think of positive things and feel a little bit hopeful then something devastating happens
 i'm frustrated
the thing that hurts me the most is the fact that all of those three years of love
 doormat me stayed
 i wouldn't want to be friends with me
i have no hope for the future
 fighting for my right to be cared for
 i'm so scared and i feel so alone with these feelings
i have no friends in school or life
 the car that was in front of me left
 nobody loves me
i'm in my fifties in chronic pain and have been severely depressed for 7 years now
 this is info she wouldn't even give up
 i feel like i was never equipped with the skills to be here
 and now i feel much much worse
 i feel guilty for not being happy and wished there was a way for this pain to stop
 they all passed by as if i had never existed
 i went to the er because something in me just gave way and i needed to turn somewhere
 after checking the info on the box of condoms about failure possibilities i discovered pin holes in all of the unused condoms
so far literally nothing good has ever happened to me in this life
 this thinking sounds greedy
a few months ago
 my birthday recently passed and my only wish was to never wake up again
 i have no job for over 3 years
i know this may be a difficult question to just ask out of the blue
 leaving me with this cold emptiness
it's so ironic when someone who picked you up from misery
 i wake up tired and have to face this crappy world like that
 starting today i'm gonna stop eating unhealthy food and gonna start working out
 no other options
 do it
 i've been called names
 i wish something would happen to me to give me legitimate reasons to take the next step
quick notes spring up on my computer screen and not give myself the trouble to check how consistent they are
 i don't want to play to get fair
 i want a baby
 she asked me if i thought i could change
 to prevent myself from getting hurt
 turned the small office against me saying i was making more than them
 last night and this morning but i feel like i have hot pads on my damn feet
 the abuse
 survive
 i couldn't remember the last time i had done that
 i just don't see anything getting better
 is there something wrong with me
 i just want the damn pain to stop
 if never been a social person
 mod edit-methodsi want to stop breathing
 sometimes i wish life would get a little bit worse
 why burden everyone
 i know way too much of the things she loves and hates
 maybe i do just want to cause everyone around me the same pain i feel
 over and over i find myself thinking
 i told him how much i feel as though i'm failing
now those are 5 good things about me
 decisions have been made and i think i am ready
 it's always something i am doing wrong in life
 i was so sad at first
 i only leave the house to go to my boyfriends but i don't even want to see him anymore because i'm this depressed and i have no desire to do anything
 myself and i
 i don't want to do anything anymore
 three years later and i still have these terrible thoughts
it was around 6 months after i was brutally raped
 so why not be a bad person
 and had suicidal thoughts just as long and can't control my impulses to hurt or kill myself under stress
 still very tired
 and it only made it worse
 i need some advice on my situation
 i was alone since the beginning
 being miserable and dragging my wife down
 but am having difficulties
 but it wouldn't bother me all to much
i tried to confide in him how i felt
 i spend my evenings and weekends doing pretty much nothing
 tired of existing
 and i don't like it
 i don't care if the people around me suffer or how they feel or anything along those lines
 i'm crying as i type and trying not to be too loud since i'm crashing at the apartment of some friends
i don't want to get into too much detail
recently i am always having trouble with self harm
i'm sick of not being greatful for what i do have
 i have been single for two years now and am so sick of it
 i am not worthy
 no car
 i have been feeling horrible inside for years
 sick of it all
 and she scold me for not telling her what my dad had asked me to do
i'm just miserable right now
if i tell my boyfriend will i just freak him out and push him away
 plus i have no evidence to the contrary
 i make way too much money to be this poor as a software engineer
 they pulled me up
 no one could tell and i was very discreet about how i was feeling
 though i have to to work
 i tried to bury myself in distractions and play many different sports as well as many hours of video games
one failed attempt already
 and i know i don't want to be away from him
 i have to beg for everything and i have to sit by while my wifes condition gets worse
 it would probably be me slowly reducing how much time i have them until i rarely have them at all
 not sure i can't take this pain any more
 all i can think about is ending it
 she actually brought in the knife to my room ready to strike
 my pcp is up the street
 sure it would mean suffering for my friends and i would prefer them to make it out of that situation unharmed physically and mentally
i don't need much attention though
 the only thing i've gotten out of these are side effects that i'd rather not be dealing with
 i hate how no matter what people say to me or do to help me: i always think and feel like no-one cares about me
 one grandparent had clinical depression and the others were all pretty removed from friends etc
 tried to understand why people don't like me
 and since then i managed a trip to the store because i needed bread for the next days
 i lost my job because of this
 i constantly wish a terminal illness would strike me down
i dress up in fursuits to look like a dog
 i've been pushed
but it did happen
 i never wanted to do anything
 i find it hard to deal with
 she knew i was not well and now she treats me with stupidity and coarseness
 my outlet turned to self-gratification
 something in me tells me just do it
 it really just felt good to know i was damaging myself though
 he said it never got passed a few make out sessions
 i already said sorry and they said everything was okay
 he was tired of hearing it
i think it scared me to realise how close i had come & how it's not the answer
 because my anxiety skyrockets in social situations
 i have also thought about just leaving and not looking back
 always looking over my shoulder
 i feel scared of what i could do
 i just wish to die soon
 but i don't think it would bother me at all if that were to happen to the school i attend
 i delegated so much i don't feel i know how to do my job well anymore
 loser
 and i have never felt so helpless
 i have chased them up about it to work out the right amount
 i have a culinary degree but owe tons of money in loans that are in default
 i want to say no but it's hard
 anyways
 i don't want to die but i'm being pushed into it by other sides of me
sorry to make another topic so soon but im at work right now and i cant handle this
and is not so much that i actually want to die but to change the situation
i have no life no friends just emptiness inside
 that's why i'm being very careful with whoever tried to get close to me
but i get these suicidal thoughts in my head
 i really try not to use it as a crutch
that it would be so much easier if i no longer existed
last year i ended up graduating and getting my bachelors in information technology
 over the years it has dragged me down mentally and physically
 i am sick to death of being a hideous zit-backed midget failure of a waste of life
 i don't have any second thoughts on doing it anymore
 and the though of disappointing & hurting loved ones that have kept me from seriously exploring it
 i can't make less but i make more than i deserve and could make elsewhere
 remember when
 so i assume he's telling the truth
 i feel like a monster
 but i don't
 i feel like i truly am lost
 not one event but almost all events that just keep spiraling down hill
 but had to take him off life support that night
 nothing serious but damn
 at all
 self harming
 unable to change p-doctors and bad case management finally broke me to the point of not caring anymore about anything which has ended up sticking with me until now
 i am the biggest loser
it's not enough that i'm fat ugly and alone
 i was supposed to be the future
 won't work
 i had suffered in silence
 thoughts of suicide crossed my mind
 the biggest set off right now is just pain
 i feel so alone and confused
 i feel his love for me is nothing more than a friends but yet he yet he says
 if i can't support my family financially or emotionally
 i know it will damage my health
 just breaking down over worrying about going to school or completing the simplest of tasks
 i feel guilty for treating people like therapists or treating them like they should have to listen to me vent because it feels whiny and i hate the feeling i get when i vent to friends
 everyone about whom i care
 just feel stuck and tired with my thoughts
cbt therapy started last year after almost a year of trouble trying to get help with mental services here where i live
 and i keep think it will fail
 these suicidal thoughts can be so overbearing sometimes that i just want to break down and cry and usually i do
 being alone all the time
 when all i want to do is lye down and ease the pain
 meditation didn't help
 i know some of my closer friends can definitely see what's going on but i don't feel comfortable enough to explain what's going on with me yet
 but decided there is no point
 yet i'm too afraid to put myself behind the wheel
 i get hardly any likes
 so hard
 where i live you have to get on the highway to get everywhere
 ideally i've wanted to air out my mind to strangers but i've never known what to do specifically because not everyone really wants to hear someone's complaints
 yet in the end i can not help myself
 i feel jealious
 why can't i just say no and let that be that
 hoping these thoughts pass soon
 i don't think of myself as a bad person in anyway for having these thoughts although a lot of people may
 it's against my beliefs to commit suicide and i know ending my life is not the answer because it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem
 i can't take this anymore
 both the sh and the anxiety and my avoidance behavior
 i cannot cope with the fact that my world
 i can't fail when i try
 the worthlessness that i feel
 don't get me wrong i wouldn't do it myself or help the cause but i don't think i would care much if i saw that happening all before my eyes
i feel like i'm borderline invisible
 he said i'm very special to him today though
despite those boo-hoo's
i just realized what today was
i'm struggling still from last night i had hopes that some sleep and a new day would change maybe improve it even just a little bit
 so pathetic
 please even share your thoughts with me or if you have any advice
 and they feel far outweighed by the bad
 i even stopped drinking
 i know too many details about her interests
 have i screwed up so bad
 i didn't think i could afford a divorce
 i'm not even living
 well i'm sort of having nightmares
 and now i'm left friendless
 i have nobody to talk to and everything i own is getting broken to the point of being unfixable
 i can see clearly that i have lots and lots of reasons to keep fighting and to stay here
 but i don't wanna play anymore
 but i know i can't live with this pain anymore
lately i've been feeling ugly and useless
 but never really had any friends
 i feel like i live at the vets
 i'm about to take something for it soon
 if i could go back i wish i would have taken better care of me heart
 i read other posts and can relate so strongly to the unbearable pain and fatigue
 i don't really keep friends because they've always been more trouble than they're worth
 everytime i think i hit bottom i fly off a cliff and down another mountain
 i sit here in constant pain
every single step that i take in this world reminds me of her
 the t just follows me everywhere i go
i need help
 i'm only a burden to my wife for instance for many reasons
 being treated like garbage
 when i confronted him he apologized to me and said she told him we were separated and getting a divorce
 my parents all blame stuff on me
 i woke up from a nightmare
i feel like he's stating the truth and than another part of me doesn't believe him cause i suffer with lots of trauma in my life and i want to be happy
 next plan would probably be to divorce and do joint custody
 i truly feel trapped
 right now i am going through a rough patch
 it has decayed and broken to a point where recovery is simply impossible
 it would drive me actually insane
now i don't care anymore
 the piece of shit that i feel
 i understand that's the easy way out
 everything is my fault
as a child i was always described as a sad and angry child
 i have been emotionally scarred and to make it even worse
 i refuse to take pills and go to a doctor who views me as just another prescription
 i know someone must be wondering why
 because there is no better way to describe them
 i feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way but all i want tonight is to join him
 too
my husband took his life a little over a month ago
 i've managed to get through a couple storms so far this spring with minimal negative repercussions but i guess i can't dodge all of them
 nothing works
 i was so messed up lately that i just went off for a week or so just to get away from it all
i am tired all the time
 feeling so overwhelmed by everything and i just cant take it
 before having kids
i have been listening to prince all night
 so lonely
 this time i did leave
 or what to do
i'm tired of fighting
 they haven't allowed me to eat or drink anything for the whole day
i don't know if i am straight
had a sort of breakdown in class today
 i was told i was anemic in august
 this time i have a plan so i should really tell somebody before its too late
 online is so toxic - everywhere everyone seems to be going through one thing or another
 and do all the right things
 a piece of shit
 i want to be here for the future when my boyfriend can move here and we can build all the things i never had
 how do i raise a child when half of me is gone
 unemployment is still tough here yet i know i have to try
 i won't lie
 as i have posted here before
 my mind
 i can't do those things in peace anymore
 and the letters 'mj' which is also a shortened version of my real name in red
 never have i been closer to anyone
 i was so numb
 its been pounded into my head that is the wrong thing to do
 but this was one of my worst attempts
 i'll never amount to anything
 i feel like i don't deserve to be sad or upset because i don't rightfully have any room to complain about my life or life in general
 he has no idea what he means to me
i knew it's my fault
since last year my life has become meaningless to me for many reasons
 that she will be with someone else
 my chest hurts
 this crisis of mine began about three months ago
 i am just cold and numb inside
 i hate how pointless it all feels
 she doesn't want to hear it
 i still feel very lost
 at least
 i hate life 
 it is so scary
 this made me socially awkward and gave me extremely low self-esteem
 i can't stop crying about it
 i just have this huge void where my feelings used to be and all that's left is this overwhelming sense of despair and i just cannot cope any more
 but was he right
 but i want to stay and make it work
 all my dreams crushed or impossible
 but does anyone have any advice
i tried to ignore them
thursday he's getting a second scan of his brain since one they did recently was inconclusive and we're both pretty worried
 i am of absolutely no use to anyone
 i'm scared that they'll put me in some kind of mentally ill hospital or something and i'm not sure i like the sound of that
 i don't have a job to go to
 i don't know what to do
after several suicide attempts
 when i die
i can't live with this anymore
 thinking that it's not cheating if there's no sexual relationship that you're cheating on
hazel
 by becoming emotionally dead
 i don't want to be labelled - but then this is the only way to get help it seems
 they really broke me
 out of nowhere
 i can't hold in the pain of feeling forgotten
 i understand his side of this
 i wish this would all go away but i can't leave this earth because i'm the only one my mom has
 but i'm getting there
 i go out of my way to try and hang out with people where i live now and i continuosly get shut down
 seeing as we are near bankrupt
i know there is no concrete answer to this question or none of us would be on this forum right now
 i have to be ready to go soon
 it's next to impossible
 i am a loser who sits home and drinks and smokes weed all day because i have nothing else going for me
 the most disgusting lowest scum
 i know this is very selfish of me and i know this is silly
 but i guess it is time when it has to end
anyway
 without trying
 i sort of stopped fearing pretty much anything
i've realized that there are so many things that i don't like about my life
 but nothing ever changes
i wonder what will fuck me up next
 i can't ever see the end of this
 i don't want to sound like i am crying out for attention
 honestly i don't really care if i die or not - i just want to attempt suicide and see what fate chooses for me
 i know there are factors leading into this
 because we're digging into a lot of tough things before i am starting dbt
 just hoping that when i wake up tomorrow the feeling will go away or at least be lessened
 i am undergoing therapy right now
 i was just out getting some food for the house and dreaded every second i was out
 and have come to realize that i got married because that's what i was supposed to do
 so why can't i just leave
 i still have absolutely nobody to talk to
so i think to try it out as ive been told it suppose to sort of help
we get no money it will be my fault
 i don't know about my family but i think they don't care
 but then i feel trapped here
 they never really cared about how i feel
 i just needed a change of scenery
 noisily
i've been having a really hard past months
 no support
 because acting is all i'm good at and all i've ever wanted to do
 usually i do not hear them
 but then i need the help
 i'm scared to reach out on my sleepless nights to my friends that say they are here for me
 i see the path forward yet so frequently walk backwards
 i hate to post again
i feel weird tonight
 i'm even scared to ask for a new textbook or even to walk into assembly
 can't throw myself into my favorite past time
 i feel like no one gives a shit about me and i don't give a shit about myself anymore
my life has probably been more difficult than some and easier than others
too much on my mind
 i start therapy and probably meds soon but even if this helps i feel betrayed
*just thought i'd get that off my chest
 you should start losing weight and get rid of this thing you really hate about yourself so 
it will become too much
 i don't talk to anybody
i don't even know why im trying to hold on
 i just want to end it all
 that would hurt even worse
 i am turning our relationship into a toxic one
i wouldn't have to study for finals
 i hate feeling like this but i hate myself and everything about myself
 to listen to me
 i did have some support for a short while but it seems that this was temporary
 i've lost all motivation to do anything at all
 i don't want to learn anything new
 maybe i am this fatigued from the anemia
 i took a month off
 a nobody
 i should have left her then
 someone who accept me and my problems
 when i get there today they call me up and tell me they don't take my insurance and ask me to leave
 but i have my kitties
 i'm at work
 we do have a cheap rental lined up though
i think what stops me from ending this life
 i want something to happen to me so that i can just die already
 but i wasn't sure
my mind is a mess
 i'm scared of death
 im tall
 one friend is all i could ever ask for
 or even just a stranger's kind word
 becasue trust me
 anytime i think it is starting to i fall apart again and i'm tired of being in this much pain
 i find myself telling small lies to him as he asks me why do i bother seeing him if i want to die so badly
 i'm angry that he's in the ground and i'm up here
 that may be wrong now that i think about it
 i was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and given a cpap to use
 i now have a full plan of how it all will end
 i've been like this for years and it always comes back to feeling this way
i'm never going to change
 but it gets harder to live each day
i don't know what i should do
 and blood dripping down my arm from them
 so if the tests were positive i would refuse treatment - which means there is nothing to be accomplished by having the tests
medications for me have varied from doing nothing to worse then to somewhat okish
 i'm only fifteen
 no reason to be here
 groin
 i am merely just existing
 so i know my wife can figure things out and eventually find a new husband
 and it was before my back problems and surgeries to try and fix the problem had started
 but when i got here
 is getting a new one starting soon
i wouldn't have to deal with intrusive memories and intrusive thoughts
 it was of a little girl saying 'i feel really
 but i don't have many drugs available and i think cutting on an ongoing basis is like slow suicide
 again
i know that compared to everyone else who is struggling with suicide
 perhaps i just looked for treatment too late
 i am 5 months pregnant with our second child and it has not gotten any easier
 substance abuse
looking at a day filled with people who don't give a shit about me
can't take this pain right now
 feeling like i wanted to kill myself
 the pain
 maybe i'll just run away to italy
 but my mum doesn't like the idea
 i can't stand the idea of keeping a general because i'm so critical of saying or thinking negative/sad things it makes me cringe
 but i won't get to see all the places on my planet because i'm doubtful i'll come into a large sum of money
 i wouldn't stop the suffering even if i could
 if it's not severe pain in my lower back
 i've dealt with low self esteem
 that maybe my heart is telling me to die
 can only deal with the yard in small pieces
 as long as i'm alive at least i have a choice
 lately i have just wanted to hurt myself and cause myself pain
 because i want a baby and to be back home
 and so it's no use trying
 in october my dad returned home and decided to quit his job on disability leaving us with no income and no health insurance
i can't do anything
 i can not walk at night because i can't see
 etc
 i'm so tired of it its making me lose my mind 
i have a person in my life
 and my body hurts
i was recently sexually assaulted by a neighbour and am scared to even go out
 i'm expected to keep the business going by getting work
 not just barely two hours before she wanted to meet up
 it's really a logical next step given everything i've tried and been through with no results
 i had 3 methods lined up even
 what stops me
 i've had my things stolen
e's and f's and i feel like a failure because i'm not getting the grades i used to
 asthma gets in the way
i don't know what i'm doing
 she begged me to come back for the kids
 everything
i was committed into a psych ward for suicide 8 years ago for 4 days
 meeting my rapist over and over again
 yet i hate every moment of it
 that fucked me up
 i escaped my abusive parents
fucking hate life
 what used to be on this earth years before us
 i don't want to be a father
everything screams
 who i saved and could not leave so they save me from suicide too
 he would find me on busses
5 years into a depression that feels like it's just taken over my life
 i would be at peace then
 i'm exhausting emotionally in dealing with anything really
but all i want to do is to say goodbye
 i now look back at decisions i've made and mistakes that seem so stupid
 it's just another hurdle
 recently i got my report back and found that some of my grades are lower than some people's grades who are in lower classes than me
 because i will be permnantly gone
 i am afraid
 and it is all my fault
 if i have the disease and do nothing about it
i hate how i'm so quiet and shy that people pick on me as they know i won't try to defend myself
 i would probably attempt to survive out of instinct at the time but i looking at it now and after the event itself it would mean nothing to me
 frankly
 i lost my job; and at some point i will be homeless
 i want to stop that feeling
 it didn't help
 except he has absolutely no idea
 the only person i really trusted
 and taking them won't get rid of the tinnitus
 another reason i stopped taking them
 to me
 i just needed to whine i guess
 i have done a lot of counseling already and i just can't seem to get better
 i then proceed to ruin my life and my wifes life
 if not then i'm scared
 i don't want to be alive but i have no specific plan of my own i just have the wish
 and how little she seems to value our time by repeatedly doing this to us
 most days i can't stand listening to 'man in the mirror'
 and not one cares for my well-being or cares in general
 i will simply toss aside the advice they give me and go on with my misery
the truly frustrating part is that i've done all of this to myself
for the last two years i've been horribly fatigued
 i was doing everything to push it to the back of my mind & ignore it
 i am gay and engaged but i feel like i'm lost and trapped
 is so demoralising and depressing for me
 i cannot feel any hope anymore
 i laughed and said
 i think what happened is that i coasted
 i think about suicide
 but instead ive become the problem
 i wish i could just not exist anymore
 my new year is way too young and i can't connect to them emotionally
 i earned this
 i like my job
i've thought of leaving
blegh
 it causes me black and white spots like tv static in the visual field and disturbances in evenings when this is most notable
 i look fat
 i'm the last person to kill myself
i want out
 i must make that feeling go away
 shortly into our relationship she pressured me into not using condoms saying it'll feel better and that she's on birth control
but i'm 37
everyone in my life always seems to leave in the end
 my heart has been ripped out
 i can see why but it really really upsets me
 i'm just here
 she was my priority
 the harder it is to fight
 typically when i feel like shit i try not to vent it at all to her and look for alternatives because i don't want to condition her into expecting depressing stuff out of me when i message her
 because my company is becoming less financially viable as i'm not bringing in the work
 it just came on after a conversation with a work-friend who was doing things with his life
 even though i'm all alone
usually its very difficult to effect me so deeply that i'm terrified
 which i want nothing but revenge so badly it hurts
 how long will i have to live
 it feels like my logic brain is still sedated
 all it took was turning that corner
 they never take you seriously until you harm yourself
 single and deeply unhappy
 it's this part that acts first when i'm met with triggers and bad memories
 i'm new here
 i have no friends or family
 you can tell a person who's depressed and lonely that it may get better
 i know i messed up because i have to pay for it everyday for the rest of my life
 i didn't want any more kids and i surprisingly held my ground
 sorry if it does
 and here i am
 that just wants to scream and throw stuff and hurt my body to get all these horrible emotions out
lately
 i didn't even move
 but i wasn't thinking too clearly when i got it
 i was realizing begging the angels to take me away wasn't enough any more
 he reminds me of how i was when i was his age
i'm alone
 i am rapt with anxiety about this
 so what happened
 he watches movies all day and complains of how hopeless and depressed he feels
 over the years i have found that talking over problems has very very little affect on me in helping in shape or form
 then i can seconds later think it's all hopeless & i have to do away with myself as i can't cope with the pain of not being with her
 i kinda have this calmness surrounding me
 she will do things that i always wanted to do with someone else
my problem i suppose is that i have many physical curses
every day i dread waking up because i know that i will have to fight the urge to want to kill myself all day long
 and ruin my family further
 and i can't handle it
