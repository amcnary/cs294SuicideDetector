 i want to fight
 angry and thinking that dying is the way to go right now
 but that shouldn't be
 leaving would mean never seeing him again
 god
 they're burning and i have a migraine too
 my computer
 i even managed to make a plan for my last trip
 so here i am
 the only person i feel comfortable talking to is unavailable right now
sorry
 i am just numb and flat
it hurts so bad to know i got to that point
 when he goes out with them not answering his phone to anyone
 i am on my own and have been for some time
 missing a few people that have passed away and am very stressed
 the years i was on zoloft
 i talk more to my long distance friends about it and another close friend here who isn't in school with me
 i will always be a sore loser who will always be talentless and friendless 
my life was saved though
 empty
last november
things build up over decades until they become unbearable
now i just feel like none of it matters
i saw my therapist today
 i hate that my parents thought that they needed kids
 i'm behind in almost every class and i have no motivation or concentration to care or catch up
 i have written a lot of letters including the goodbye ones
 i hadn't even bothered writing a letter
 it's taken courage to even get to this point
i have never felt so bad in all my life
 so tired
 only accepting a cure which does not exist
what should i do
 i was in the shower and found him in the garage
 so more money to pay out
 my mind is so broken at this point that i'm a danger to people around me
 i met someone
 i spend the night sleeping on the couch but my mind kept thinking of how much i have been failing
 losing a child
 then she went on accusing the things that i haven't done - stealing
i've never felt so alone before
 since i was younger
how long is necessary to pretend to be good for it to come true
 i have always been isolated since birth
i could never ask for anything better
 the first therapist i met with referred to my life as i described it as a big pile of shit
 in the morning when my boyfriend asks how i am ill probably just say 'fine'
 from having bad side affects to not being able to sleep to hearing voices and seeing people
i'm a college student
i've been told that i'm not a failure
 don't have the courage to kill myself
 overextended the problem is i took my work for granted and let myself coast
 i've self harmed
 i don't see a point to this
 what choice do i have
 i crave the comfort of religion but i just can't bring myself to ever believe in that
 but he doesn't need me to be down
 i'm afraid that if i move out
 blurry vision and it's not like our life is terrible but i'm young and i feel so whipped
 if i can make it look like an accident
 because quite frankly who would read it or care
 i was born with a severe clef lip and palette which took many surgeries to mostly fix
tiger skye
 i'm afraid to do something
 to name but a few
 i feel overwhelmed
 too much to do
 having the same thought again
 really unwell
 but i finally found friends with whom i could connect
 and nobody bothered or cared to look down at my dead body
 so yeah
 i hate this world
 it was and has always been me
 and eventually realized i no longer make new friends
 the more i want to listen to that little voice in the back of my head
 yet they refuse to do anything
 i'm not a killer
 i don't want to get it wrong
 i been pushing everyone away
 and i spend everything i make
 i resent having these kids but i don't resent the kids themselves
 it's all just too much and feels like i am going to explode
 i realize i have depression and i'm not fond of that and i just think every gets sad
i don't know what to say
 my feelings hurts
 to put it bluntly
 install myself <edit - methods>
 i don't want to keep hurting but it seems inevitable no matter what i choose i'll be leaving something behind
 i have been trying to do my work but unsuccessfully
 if you want me gone i understand because everyone else does but my wife
 this is probably due to the fact that i feel i've dealt with an unfair amount of pain throughout my life and i feel it isn't fair that everyone else isn't experiencing the same pain as i am
 those were my first time i feel so empty
 something i do not want to live with
 not wanting to involve another human being in my demise
 i hate how i'm too shy to speak to people
i don't want to feel a thing
 suicide seems logical and rational
 my pastor and the rest of those hypocrites didn't help 
 i felt like no-one would care anyway
my dreams are crushed
 stupid problems at work with boilers and internet not working etc and people making it hard for me to sort out
 my mind refuses treatment
 i wanted no commitments
 how right now i'm on here with the chance of having at least one other person read this across the globe while i continue through the week and grow and age
 people are too busy working and having lives - things i don't have anymore
 i have so much pain psychological and physical
 i'm so drained emotionally and physically
 the whole lot
 and everything is just so screwed up
 this caused a bad spike
 i am leech and a monster
 but i'm not
so much pain right now
 it was work related
i began writing secret letters so that i would be able to see my progress
 but for now i am just pretending
 i've been posting a lot lately cause i'm emotional and i tend to get very sensitive by things
 i can't afford the pills
no one would miss me because there is nobody left
 who is trying to get better
 why can't i be better
 i suddenly couldnt do my job
i keep having a lot of nightmares it got to the point that every time i go to sleep i beg god that i don't have a new nightmare 
 i have ruined my life
 someone who
i poured my heart out to him
 we live with her mom who has paid and continues to pay for everything for us over the last 7 years
 which was planned around her only
i think about my tinnitus all day at work
 i get these thoughts of self harm randomly when positive things aren't going well for me such as my relationship
i am not exactly sad
 i kept finding small problems that kept me awake and tried to solve them
 i drink and smoke so that i can calm down or at least go to sleep
 this would lead to me losing the internship
 its not worth it
 that is why i want to do it
 and i just need my friends back
 so that i could die in bliss
i am now ready to try again as its the only way i see
 i don't want to live anymore
 make me seem ungrateful
 waste of time
 i can't bear the irony of failing a suicide attempt
 i feel stuck because i chose poorly in the past
 i used to get top marks in one of my classes every week when we did our weekly test but now i've gone down to c's
 ugly
 i was expecting it hours earlier
 three dilemmas
 yet i feel nothing
 i decided to turn my life around
i'm really insecure about myself
 i hate this country
 tears keep falling out of my eyes
to think that i was worrying about what i would talk about with my counselor at my next appointment
 he didn't quite understand it because no one who doesn't suffer from it could fully understand it
i often think my death
i'm all ears
 then my car got towed from a place we have always been allowed to park
 no admittance to hospital
 i'll mess up so much
 he is now in high school
 though my psychiatrist would not diagnose this
i just wish i would stop being here
 it feels like i'm being bullied by my own different ghosts
 but does that honestly stop you from saying
 i wasn't ready to see his lifeless body around that corner
 so wasteful
 i don't know how to answer that question
 i don't want anyone to think badly of him
 everyone seems to want something from me in the chaos following my divorcing my parents
but i don't know
 i feel like i'm always looking back
 years and years of therapy can't undo the damage that was done to me as a little girl and i don't want to even grow older
 i feel like i'm not good at anything and compliments on things i do just make me feel bitter and exhausted because i don't want to pretend i agree with people who think i do anything right
i cant hold or hug people
 drowning in those unreal feelings i felt whenever i imagine myself in certain situations
 i should have left her
 this post doesn't even give details of why this has come about
 if this was a place negative comments where allowed
i don't know what to do anymore
 with my current sick baby
 it's on the inside where none of it feels good
 who is mentally fragile
 because they started to get bad again
 and began to realize that i hated the person i had become
 and the reason i finally had enough was that i was forced to attend my rapist's birthday celebration
 it would take a neighbour complaining about the smell that would lead someone to my body
 too bad they are not life-threatening
 i am trying not to fall further
 i recently went on a psychological course
 eventually i would get a pyschotic break
 one employer has already stated no go yet have not heard from other 3
 and almost made me forget all about my sadness and my anxiety
 and death keeps racing through my mind
 let me die let me die let me die
 thrive
 damn it hurts
 here i was
 i feel like i should just give up
 i feel like me leaving this world is the only thing i can think off
 i can't continue that
this is weird
 why am i even still alive
 or to allow myself to be vulnerable enough to do so
 if everyone were to drop dead around me i feel i wouldn't have any problem with it at all
 and it doesn't seem like i worry about the consequences
 i just needed to talk
i don't have any family
 it broke through my numbness somehow and i sat there frozen
 they don't need me anymore
i'm so wrapped up in my wife that nothing else seems to matter
when i tried last time i remember feeling so calm about everything
 i want to scream the pain is so bad
 i must be fucked up in the head to feel like this constantly
 i was hiking last year and when i got to the peak it was so beautiful
 i used to have purpose and hope
 then you would understand
 things i don't want to speak about to anyone for you all would see me as a monster if i did
 i'm only saying that because he's reading over my shoulder
 and the concept is really weird
 it's something else that is completely stupid because they are so impatient
 i could literally feel something in my brain like a myelene sheathe rip or something
 however
 but when you want to die and commit suicide
 couldn't take care of myself well and did things like come to work late inspite of trying to fight back against him
i have never felt so helpless
 i don't have guys to get a drink with
 everything
how do i get graduate if i cannot even go to class
 i am no longer living
 but while i had been expecting the email today
 and gets mad at me every time i've tried to take them over
mine isn't
obviously
 i really
 and none of it is pleasant
 we have a single income home no pressure there
 worn out and incurable
my supervisor is out to get me
 when we had kids
i hate pain
do i want to survive this easter long weekend or dont i
 maybe it's just an anxiety thing
 i want to si again
 but you cannot tell me that
 also had many ear infections which slowed my speech development
 then boom
 a psychiatrist will not help me
i've had an eating disorder for a while now and whenever i eat i feel like i'm a failure
 i don't do anything right
i can't even put this is words but if there's anyone that feels remotely similar
 my thoughts don't even make sense
 she told me no matter what i'd most likely always be afraid
 but i guess its cathartic to dream of a way out of this mess and a way to escape my thoughts for once
 that's why i built those 'walls'
 so i went there and asked why the fuck they'd give me a referral for an office that doesn't take my insurance
 but i'm okay right now
 i was shocked that after my brain did that great tangent about how wonderful it looks was that the next immediate thought was to just jump off the edge
 there are so many days that go by that i regret not going through with my suicide instead of getting help
i don't know if i really had the delusion that i could be completely over everything one day
 he's gone out to meet these mates of his and i'm terrified he won't come home
 i'm not in danger
 a year and a half later and i'm still struggling with this shit
just
 the thing is
 just keep thinking maybe everyone is better off without me 
 they will all go by and live their lives as if i didn't exist
 i am old
 maybe
 it hurts so bad that it hurts physically
 i told her no
 then i shredded the note and climbed into bed with my man
 i've had things thrown at me and i feel like a failure that
 i'm too crazy for this world
 i am sick of trying
i'm trying - out of habit but i'm trying
i can't stand this anymore
 i gave her everything
 no idea what even from and only 8
 i did the work
 the least i could do is live with being a loser
 i was diagnosed with ptsd
 but i was to cowardly to turn to anyone for help
 my death is as insignificant as that of the tiniest ant
 well i feel just as bad at him yet i am in my senior semester of college and have come the far so i might as well tough it out until may
 and those were my first time i feel so terrified by emptiness
 a weaker person
 that long
 i try to change my situation
 i waited too long
 protesting when the kids ask for some help with something
 even after my suicide
those horrible thoughts are here and i'm so tired of suffering
 it is in an area where it could be years until something in my budget and i am scared to stay in this neighbourhood now as the harassment is almost every day
 that's enough bleating about my problems
 or somewhere
 i try to talk about everything i want to do
raising our kids almost single handedly
 when i'm alone i do nothing but cry and have panic attacks
 there was not a single action i did without considering her feelings
i so wish i were dead
 tomorrow i am going to resign from my job as it's causing me too much stress
 nor will a hospital
 because i am 'functional'
 i was at the cusp of full independence within arms reach of seizing almost everything major i wanted to get out of life
 never could connect with anyone
 i'm sorry that i have failed you all
 so much time and effort
 but yeah
 has turned out to be a lie
 and i've used enough drugs i think my parents would disown me if they knew of my experience in that area
but i haven't talked about it to anyone
 just think about how vast everything is
 never have i had what i would call a real relationship until he came along
 for once in my life saw the night sky while i was sitting alone on top of office building
 especially my loser of a father i had rip but still
 i know it does
 it turned out so ugly though
 what kind of horrible person does that make me
 for the first time i tried to make myself purge and i know it's not pleasant
 i have been suicidal since i was 9 years ago
 today at least is only a dip
being behind the computer screen and researching is nothing like going out there and being poised to do it at that very moment with the very real aspect of failing and going home/being discovered
 and i'll be seen as the kid who tried but couldn't die
 and was rejected
 i don't feel bad for the unfortunate nor do i care about those around me
 this is not an exaggeration
my background is i had no father
 seeing the absolute mess that i have made of my life
 i don't have any more fight in me to continue
 time to go
i'm seeing the doctor tomorrow to see if he can change my meds as the last lot didn't do anything for me
 i think i will go into psychiatric ward
 i love my parents so much and i am only here for them
i'm so stressed out
 no friends
 i have found solace in my depression
i think i'm just too tired to keep going
 dark
 am in no mood to try and figure out medicare
 he has been reading up on abused women and rape survivors and what else i have been through
 but i don't want to
 i won't si because i promised someone i know and care about that i wouldn't
 but she hoped to make me considerably less afraid
 my boyfriend doesn't understand mental illness
 i know the pain suffered by those who are left behind
 it has brought me back to those few times i went out there to do it 
 but in the end
 right now i feel like doing something destructive or hurting myself in some way
 sort of
 i'm not going to get another job
 i can't keep feeling like this
 since i have to do whatever they say
 career is shit
 i do not
 i don't think i am being crazy at all to do this
 thought was stolen so was very stressful
 i'm triggered by being ignored and now i have so many negative and angry thoughts going on through my head
 and i don't have the tools to fix it
 i was ready to walk out the door
 so frustrated
 its like it knows something i don't
 it pains me to feel so poorly about everything and unable to find joy for long periods of time
 no one wants to be with someone like that
 but i spent all this money on equipment
and idk how much longer i can hold on
 i'm worse
 but even with cpap therapy
speaking of work
 i have an awful memory
 i was here first and other people being inpatient decides to blame me because they are inpatient and i'm being patient by following the rules
 we've had bad luck with medical bills and are heavily in debt
 no one would find me
 i'm sorta going blind and my partner seems to not really see that i'm struggling while he has a job
 my dad called me to scrub the toilet and i did
 when is it time to call it
 people i pay charges to for my business have miscalculated the amount
 like this shit has an off switch
 those were my first time i feel so lonely in my own bedroom
 i really can't cope and see no way out
 my kids are young enough that they'll move on
 so it doesn't matter
i really don't think i can ever be normal again without her in my life
 that i had to scrape away at it
 which is not even scary
 because i was alone
 as if they hate me
 it is getting to be a tiring battle that i don't want to take part in anymore
 and the chronic pain had started
why do i struggle over these trivial matters that really don't matter in the grand scheme of things
 nobody will mourn my death
 just to exist a bit longer
 it's all about being picked up and destroyed by others
emotional pain on top of stress from a new job
 they get the authorised version
i have been discouraged since birth
 i am this irresponsible piece of shit
today i woke up feeling like shit and thought about all of the things i hate about myself one of them is my overweight problem so i said to myself you know what
i just don't want to be selfish
 smoked
 my fault
 i'm now receiving therapy & psychotherapy
 behind my knees and down the backs of my lower legs
i've never been a go-getter
 after all
 especially when you try reaching out
here's a little bunny
 i can't breathe and emotionally i need to lay down for the last time
 i can't find a job
 it'll be too easy for me to slowly exit the kids lives
 the main thing keeping me going is moving but if i lose the place
 i just can never find to pick out something i like about myself
 it's also hurts
 i don't neccisarally want to hurt everyone around me except those who have hurt me
 the real me is this
 i did try for four years to get a voiceover career going
 not sure why i am writing this because i feel nothing matters anymore
no one hears
 it's more like i just don't care if everyone has to suffer
 it's so bad that i couldn't even find joy at the birth of any of my 4 kids
 but when i really just needed him to be there for me
 but i am crying right now
 they sick and tired of me
 but because they distract me from the pain
then there's a lack of out-of-marriage relationships
 depressed
 but i know that i no longer have the desire 
 four years ago
 to just be at peace
 i am alone in this world
 i don't care that it won't look like an accident
i have looked for help for several years now
 and now i find that fact hard to deal with
 i'm nothing and the pain of it is eating a hole in me
 i know the temptation to hurt/kill myself while driving is there
 with no kids
 so upset
my mistake was that i planned my whole life around her
i'm not suicidal but i don't want to be here
 or hope i get involved in a road crash
 thank god i didn't succeed
 she thinks this is her fault
i will die sooner rather than later
 i think about killing myself many times a day
i am really scared because i feel like i could easily go over the edge
i'm so unhappy & miserable
 and dealing with the aftermath
 i have diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia for several years ago
 doing what i knew i should have been doing and didnt' it freaked me out
the key i guess is to keep looking if you don't apply at least look
 they put up a tiny temporary sign
 cars
 why did i survive
 feelings do not need logic
 and maybe they'd get a step-dad that can be emotionally present for them instead of this fucked up person they currently have
 can't really pray for death
 i wasn't pushing him to do anything
but before i ever got to talk about that
 in the end
 i don't know when it will overcome me
 i know people say it i stressful but i had no idea how much and that it could all still fall through
 my parents did suggest i stop taking ads after 9 years of doing so
 i've been reading here and elsewhere of people's experiences at the brink of self-destruction when they were brought back from the edge by something
 all this
 and as i near 65 things just keep breaking and hurting more
 there were only people who say that
 on a cv i look like my life is sorted
 but i know for a fact that i will always be jealious and i will always feel that i am missing something inside of me
why can't it just be a diagnosis that can be medicated and let that be it
 so gradually i didn't go as much
 thrown my fetus in the trash and set it on fire
 i tried to scream for help
do you ever feel so useless to people
 i wrote a suicide note last night
but i can't figure out if i want to die or not
 business
 and it's starting to scare me
when really i just feel crushed pretty much every day and pathetic and can't beat the mountain of problems i've created for myself in my life
i just want someone who understands - someone who is not so emotionally involved that every time i talk about [self-mutilation] they cry and refuse to think rationally
 then the first thoughts of suicide appeared
 my whole body is just effing revolting
 i wanted to do voices in cartoons
i want to talk about the way i'm feeling again but i can't even tell people i tried in february because i'm scared it will push my friends and family away
 it hurts every single day and it's just not worth it anymore
sometimes i feel like i am not going to get another job because i'm 55 yet i do continue to try
 pregnancy scares
 i'm not interesting
i wouldn't have to face my parents again
 i just feel the only way to end this is to end my life
 cutting and even contemplating death
 if i only had a physical disease and we could all get together and say goodbye
 and that i failed you all
 i am here as i have nobody to talk to at all
 i feel like i was always destined to be this piece of shit
but i am a little scared if it doesn't kill me
 i dont want to take another breath
 it all needs to stop
 my hemoglobin went down again last month to 9
 but i don't know how to face the world without my husband
i really feel that it's time for me to actually do it
 suicidal thoughts seem logical to me
 i was all alone
 not this time
 either way i can't take this suffocating loneliness anymore
 which means i'll lose my house
i can't leave my house anymore without strangers being so rude to me
 i know they wanted it to since they have starved me for the whole day
 but i long for it
 but i feel like others would be ultimately better off
 i want to crawl in that coffin with him and just die
 i'm just physically and mentally worn out by the physical pain
i want to silence what is around me because i can not silence my mind
 i have a long pattern of losing friends
 i'm scared to walk out in public because i hate the way i look
 and there's no use trying - i haven't been able to get on the internet until now i live in china
i feel like a failure all the nights i've been up
 couldn't sleep because of pain and my damn feet were hot
 or karma
 i'm afraid i could not stop myself as yesterday
anyone who has ever been this depressed
 but none of them care
 and very unpleasant
 i am constantly fighting like this
 if you take away the emotion you wouldn't want someone in so much pain to have to continue
 i hate my life
 i have failed more than i ever dreamed possible
 it's sad
 i can't think of any reasons not to do it
my therapist has instructed me to think of the logic side as a parental figure that needs to hug the emotional side
 but i am considering it now
 i wish i was
but when i realize
 how these something or someone made these blinds in front of me
 but whenever i don't eat i feel like i'm letting down my friends when they tell me i should eat
 i am not mean
 but i also don't want to give him up
 i have no friends for many years and this is causing big anxiety living alone and i have no future
 didn't have the courage to even do that
 recently
 or if they did come i told them i was in there for a different reason
 so much time that i have spent for her
 but i don't feel normal at all
 i've been in therapy and made progress in some things
 then a bailiff turned up at my door
 it's happened so many times 
 my suicidal thoughts crept back in
 i'm always home alone
 i want to be completely devoid of emotion
 but they are coming much less frequently than they once did
 i can't work as things are right now
 now i'm thinking i'm being ignored on here as well
 i hate how disorganized this professor is
 i fear the time where the pain overrides the guilt is coming soon and i try for that 'accidental' death
 yet i stayed
 nothing to live for
 but life just doesn't work out like you want it to
 but fml
 i'd love to understand why people think suicide is bad
 but no action
 i need someone to talk to because i've reached my limit
i feel sick
 switched office supplies so i assembled the mailers incorrectly
 i have no morality anymore
 and hardly even thought about making it to graduating high school since i was so caught up in wanting to just die
only makes me wake up all angry
 i have a phobia of silence
but i'm truly serious about this suicide attempt and when it gets to the day - will i pull through or give in
 am so worried about her and terrified of losing her
 and he's already got two daughters he adopted both grown now and out of the house he doesn't want to start over
 but if i don't sh i feel like i'm too wimpy and too much of a failure to do anything
i realize i am not like any one else
 she had beat me on a regular basis
 this is something i cannot deal with
 growing on the train
 i spend my days helping to sue people who were stupid enough to spend thousands of dollars on a vacuum
 the way i feel now is very scary
 for attention
 i can't live with this anymore
 i spent so much money on our happiness
 i'm trying very hard to pay no mind to the little voices but when i am losing hope its that much harder
 i swear
 it is difficult
 rather than got the work
 or offer me any form of real advice beyond 'well that will damage your health'
 just done
 so long
 but glad i got some of it out
 i just don't know how to go about it
 i'm too far gone
 i really do
 i know he cares and he wants to be there
 i won't cut ties with them
 i have tried every possible option including ect and many experimental treatments
i feel invisible and worthless
i was just out to get my daughter her shots and needed to fill my van with gas
 and the others are random disturbing scary dreams 
 it's making me confused about things that really happened and nightmares 
 since then it feels like things are snowballing
i know i've hardly been on this site anymore
 i don't like saying sappy or sad things in general either
 but it would not go easily
 really
 ended up breaking you
 i drank
 kiss her on the cheek and give her a hug
 ummmm
 but
 looking to past mistakes that dictate my current state and my future
 not even my worst enemies
 sadly since he died the fandom got a bit strange and so many things changed
 earlier i said i don't want people to hurt i just don't care if they do
 there have been times in my life when i've seen glimmers of hope
 suicide seems so romantic to me
 continuously rejected and treated like inferior garbage by women
 i've worked hard and i know my future might have nice avenues
 right now i'm twelve hours away from them
 i've held down jobs
 and i think this and then think how pitiful and pathetic that thought is
a few years ago
my back hurts
 that is why i keep getting the thoughts of ending it all
 the reason i feel trapped is i can't end my life due to the hurt i would cause my children and wife
no matter what i do i feel like a failure
 i've worked in the mental health field
 my 'diagnosis' is something along the lines of unspecified disturbance of the personality structure if i translate it directly
 i came off ads thinking i didn't need them anymore
my logic brain wants me to live
 the acceptable one
 i wasn't ready to give the order to take him off the only medication forcing his heart to pump
no one else i can talk to - too afraid - no one i can trust
 i have fought for help
 i've also graduated high school
 i can't remember ever felling any positive emotions such as love or joy
 tried to methods> 
 i just dont know what to do anymore
 and i feel like a shit dad and a worse husband
 ashamed
i'm having suicidal thoughts right now
 but i like the feeling
 i haven't been on a fan board in so
 she said that thing again she has said so many times
 i just coasted and collected my paycheck
why should i even live
 i just want someone to relate to this
 the more i want to die
 the pain relief i take are not nearly enough to help me
i have learned to live with this
 how can anyone hurt a child
 whatever
 my mother wanted to kill me
 i'm not sure if it's a bad thing but it's just how i feel
wish i had some support
 i wasn't successful but now i wish i was
 my hope is that if someone goes through my internet history they'll come across this post and get a brief inkling of how unhappy i feel
 i have no money
 i'm not even frightened anymore i just don't have the strenght to heal my heart again
 i guess
 i'm no use when it comes to helping her with the physical work i used to do around the house and garden
 i thought about it
 i really have no alternative but to expire; but like i said i'm scared to do that
who does that
 which i have lost interest in wanting to be in a relationship even though there is pressure from many people for me to be in one
 my wife suffers from pnes and can't work because of the seizures
 i now work outside of mental health as i thought that may help me get away from these negative thoughts
 i have to walk today and i am scared
this whole situation has completely knocked the life out of me
 wrong
i tried to commit suicide in late february <mod edit> 
 since they break site rules
i am sorry if this is against the rules
 why
 i don't have anything to live for
 i am in my forties
 which exacerbates the depression
lately school has been giving me anxiety
 not one person is there to care for me
 because its not like being dead won't mess up everything anymore than getting help will
 someone else will kiss her and do all the things we did or would do
the best way i can put how i feel is that i'm sorry for living
 but i despise their mother
 just like me
long story short i had a meltdown
 it is too painful to wake up every day with nothing to do but try not to think suicidal thoughts
 right now my eyes hurt so much
i told my mom i am unable to work yet she still nudges suggestions my way
 goddamn i wish i could die
a friend of mine posted a meme the other day and tagged me
 and nothing is helping
 the thing is i'm not scared
 i feel it is time to go
 it's just not enough
 because i could never hurt them
 suddenly i got stuck being fixated on the bad
just wish my mind would stop thinking of ending my life every time i get into an argument with someone even strangers or someone tells me if i'm doing something wrong
 i never pin that to my feelings of killing myself
 i felt like i was agreeing
 i thought of a thousand ways to kill me
 or i care
 but it's not the same since he died
 but only in my own eyes
today was hard
 i so hate being me
 i looked down and <mod edit methods /details> luckily
 i am everything i aways felt i was
 i don't understand why i'm here and it'd just be easier for everyone if i wasn't
 or myself either to be honest
 i feel like pushing everyone away right now
 i'm so tired and feel so isolated
 like sometimes i try to remember yesterday and wonder did this really happen or was it a nightmare i can't tell the difference and i'm freaking out
 but things can be going well
i feel like all my friends are so far ahead of me
 there's a long list of other things but i don't want to bore anyone
 life has been so crazy recently
 i tried to save him
 i wish i was dead
 does anyone know what will happen if i tell somebody about this
 my brother were taken away by child welfare and both are in prison
 it's just the lying
 i've just sat alone and cried and soaked up every negative thing anyone has said or done to me and let it eat me alive
 i'm sorry but i can't get the feeling out of my system the minute i started gagging
 i refuse to go on meds
i was home alone that night
 make all of those feelings go away and feel absolutely nothing
 and i feel incapable of coping with these disappointments
 so i could be free from myself
it hurts
 i didn't really think these things
 there are so many other people who have urgent situations that could use some kind of help but i'm just here because i've wracked my brain and run out of options in my mind 
begining to end
 but lately i'm sure that i can't make it
everyone here is too busy for me
 i hate them
 i knew i couldn't live like that
 the lies and blame she laid on me over the next few months was staggering
 that she was meant to be the one to me
 my asthma is barely controlled
 in fact
 she was the only person that mattered in my life
 it made me realize how much my upbringing has affected my mental health and these past six months have been particularly difficult
 all day i keep thinking about how i don't want to be alive and that i wish i could just die
 i am ignored or saying i haven't given it enough time to kick in
 brought me back to my senses
 all seems to be going down hill
 wish i methods>
 pushover me which she admits is a trait that attracter her to me gave in and at 3 months into our relationship she was pregnant
 all unrelated
 i feel trapped sometimes and alone
 i was actually starting to think that i might have a future with less pain
 and a lot of problems revolve around them
 she ended up pregnant again even though we always used condoms
 none of this was my fault
 not even my parents or siblings
 i get it
 i don't want to get better
 this year i am meant to be moving house
 but as i got older
 eventually i cheated
 then within a month and a half everything was taken from me
 i would have hundreds saying to go through with it and just end it
 tried to find a reason why i am extremely alienated
 i have never cut myself before
 it is now barely noticeable
i didn't choose this i don't know why i have to be the person i am i'm an idiot i didn't choose to be born as someone i'm disappointed in
 it hurts it hurts it hurts
 if i die in my apartment
 it brings back so many horrible memories of when i used to be ignored
no one sees the fake smile
 the only thing that keeps me from doing it is the obligation i have to these 4 kids
i'm tied of nobody ever wanting anything to do with me unless i can help them or going to an appointment
i'm tied
i have severe medical conditions/injuries that have left me in constant pain
 i didnt want to
 completed half of my undergraduate degree a year early while on a path to a masters degree
 i'm supposed to be a finishing senior but i've retaken a few classes so i'm a junior in terms of credits
 i have no desire to go anywhere or get up out of this bed
 when she showed the first signs of wanting to break it all up
 i literally do not have any friends at all
 but to no avail
 he told me that if i wanted to talk
 what did i do to deserve such misfortunes
not sure why but every time i'm in an argument with someone or someone points out something i'm doing wrong
 it starts with these serene tunes as man in the mirror starts playing
 i find no joy in anything and i keep thinking it would be such a good idea to just take my own life
 an invisible man
i want to start out saying i am sorry to hear about everyones problems and struggles
i actually stared at a <mod edit
 but i've shut all doors and can't handle atm
 and i really didn't have any place to go as i have no friends and family is in no position to take me on
 month or so really and to suddenly feel beyond crippled again is just so damn hard to deal with
 i got someone to understand
it helped a bit to cry today
 i know that my selfish reasons for wanting to continue to be here
 i will die
 why do i have to create an excuse to get out of it
 i sealed that world away from me
 there's more but it's too hurtful to go into
 tell them that they understand and validate these emotions
 i've been nearly shoved down a flight of stairs
 just bad enough to push me over the edge
 i am just waiting for the details on legalized euthanasia to be worked out here in canada and then i will apply for it
 i was never really comfortable at family gatherings
 its hard to ignore the pain
 maybe i'm becoming who i was destin to become
 he expects me to just 'be okay'
 i just don't care what happens to anyone around me anymore
i tried suicide several times
 i'm haunted by so many memories of so much abuse
last night
 i can't remember when i last felt worthy to
 clearly it didn't work
i want to know if anyone can even relate to this i don't know what kind of reply i'm looking for--if any at all
 i haven't had a day where i was happy
 she's not a bad mother to the kids
 i am just existing
 yet i don't think i am ready to die
 i think i do have everything i need if i really wanted to make that choice
 what do you think i been doing
 i thought that if i had a distraction
 just rather disappear
 i did it to make myself feel better
 for a few days i've felt lethargic and down and i want relief
my dad has been depressed and anxious all his life
wish me luck guys
but i just cant help but wonder how the f$# my brain heals itself with this crap
 i put away the methods
 but it's not
 just been thinking everyone is better off without me
 there is nobody who love me
 diagnosed with mild sleep apnea
no income
 i would have just been locked up sooner
 finances
 maybe because i may be of no use and no matter what i try
 i felt like the lie has drained out of me
i was so stressed i was eating right
 this past week has been the worst of my life
 also i'd rather have them feel constant pain throughout their lives until they hate it just as much as i do
i know there is no myelene sheath in the brain
 i wanna close my eyes and never wake up again
most answers and advice i get just feel like random phrases thrown at me
 but i know i am
 so i've had to go over to his house which at first he is annoyed by but then seems grateful for and back to his normal self
 i know i am not going to do anything and i don't want to but the thought is there and it hurts so badly
 the worse it gets
some time ago i was told i may have cancer and that i should get some tests
 staring at the screen
 my mind won't let me
 i need help
depression destroyed my relationship i'm going to kill myself method request>
 i had to get this out because i can't talk to my wife because she will go into seizures because of the anxiety this would cause
 but i know it's a shitty idea
 i'm getting back to making dinner
 stopping them three months ago only to now contract two horrible diseases
 it makes me sad to know that i nearly always feel this way
 i feel like i'm bothering them or i can't fight my own battles because i'm too weak
 my inner pain is just growing and growing without relief and i know that she would be better off without me now
 done being disappointed
 during the 'happier' times i never feel at peace and there is always my depression shadow lurking over my shoulder just waiting for a trigger
 i gave everything to that person
 by that time i was broken
 i've lost someone important to me to suicide before i can't let it happen again
i felt like this at new year's then on the 5th of january one of my kitties suddenly died
 i know it's selfish but like i said it's just a thought
 years of battling this disease has not made me any better
i think i'm too much of a coward to actually do anything
it just feels like some really
 my story isn't all that bad
 as i have never attended college and had to withdraw from my studies due to being severely bullied
 i've declared for the last time that i've lost my battle with depression
today i was talking to a friend of mine online
 i currently go to class and i know school/university shootings are thought of as a terrible thing
 i caved to stop the constant pressure and nagging
 if i were to die today or tomorrow it wouldn't bother me the slightest
 i don't want to be a husband or a father
 i am lonely i chose work over friends
 gay or neither
i have my suicide planned out - i have almost everything ready down to the date and time and method
 but it just makes me feel crappy for all my personality traits
 stupid things like the parcel man has left a parcel at the shop where i got assaulted
 i wonder how's it like to be numb from everything
 my brain wouldn't allow me to
 it's severe nerve pain in my hips
 well the current state of my medications have not been working for along time now and when i ask for a review or a change
 so i took a trip out of state to see my mom who i'm not really all that close to
how long will this last
 my kitties are my reasons to live and is like losing a child to me
 to worse
i had planned on asking her if she thought i was borderline or something like that
 i don't really visit this site as much as i use to when i really needed to talk as i felt bad that i am trying to help people
feel free to correct me if it isn't
 but because of my mental state
i used to belong here
 receiving little or none
 i don't have friends because i don't allow anyone to know the real me
 but my boss actually wanted me to stay
 i am looking for support groups in my area so i can feel less alone about having these negative feelings
 so that i won't drowned in there
 but i know she had done those things
 i live a waking hell and wish my life on no one
 i'm so ashamed of myself for not being positive enough or not doing the best i can as far as college and my part-time job go
 then
 which makes me feel even more low
maybe i'm just expecting him to say it
 during the time of trying to get the services i had a few troubles with attempts at suicide
 they come randomly sometimes in the day or when i have depressed bouts
they were showing the movie 'moonwalker' that evening
 really happen
btw i can't go back on them because i'm participating in a clinical trial and i have to be clean for that another two months besides
 i've been freezing all yesterday
 surely no-one is expected to live with pain like this
 i'm very scared to do this
 my duty to these kids keep me from doing it
 but pussy doormat me caved to her pleas for forgiveness and stayed
abruptly the typical sounds of dawn seep into my room
 told him what was happening and we cried for a few hours before falling asleep
 and parties aren't meant to last
 all that i am wish now for it all to be over
 am on meds for clinical depression and just feel very lost
 i didn't actually fall
 but was stopped by my brother
 just rather be gone so i don't make things worse
 they will think - she was one of the real sufferers
i stupidly tried to end it all on thursday night
 and as for those who have hurt me i want to cause an unfathomable amount of pain to
 but at least the damage is stayed and maybe things become easier for them
 so exhausted
i'm finally ready to die
 therefore
 i feel like i lost the most important person in the world to me and it is eating me up inside
 there has been no progress
 by leaving now
 as far as my own life i don't care much about that either
i feel worthless
 the sleep apnea and diabetes aren't enough
 where i used to live everyone has forgotten about me or doesn't have the time to talk
 the truth is i just don't care
i want to drive somewhere and get away
 meditate
 i've really gotten low since i started seeing her in feb
i'm going to immediately give my rebuttals to some of the posts i will immediately get
 i also went to college to get away from crap jobs now that i had a family
 i try to ignore them and it just makes them higher
 therapists
but due to this trigger i'm very depressed
 and that i just needed someone to care
 that there's no overcoming the past
 the worst part about this is that my mother works at the same company and wants me to work there with her but when i try to explain
 then i don't have to feel the pain anymore
 the thought i should get a divorce crossed my mind many times
 i took a shower and been having more thoughts
 i'm trapped in this pain and misery
 this would strain our already bankruptcy level of debt
 can't concentrate on anything
 tired of living and tired of fighting and always losing and failing
 worthless
 nothing would change bc i don't have a problem with being a terrible person why would i
i don't want to be diagnosed with anything
 i know he can find someone better
 this is hard to type because i'm fearful of being scrutinized but i've had to stop therapy and i'm concerned for my well being
 i want out
 not the same amount that was inflicted upon me
 i joke a lot about suicide and other terrible things to those around me and some believe i'm just joking and others wonder how i could say such terrible things
every single day
 couldn't find anything
 cheating and manipulation she has done to me
 my car
 but to me
 i've been sent to inpatient treatment for an eating disorder
 is this the day it can end
last night i came very close to being done
 i am not much to ask any one for help
 how did you get out of it
 building his carreer
 what will people think of me
 i don't know how to put into words what i actually feel it's complicated but it's also really minimal it's not a deep feeling it's just hard to describe
 it occurred to me yesterday
 way too much
 i feel like such a horrible mother
 and didn't want to feel alone anymore
what keeps me going
 pressed against me
 there was no funeral
 i just dont
 nothing is bringing me out of this deep dark well in which i now lurk
 i think i'm a masochist based on past choices and that i sabotage myself because i just can't help myself
 existing
not a day goes by where i don't think about taking my life
 i am not sure how much i am comfortable with writing down but i will try to at least get some basics
 i wouldn't feel bad for those who lost their lives and those who lost their loved ones
want to die
 and i can't recover from them financially or emotionally
 no relationship
 i am isolated
 but i stayed for the money
 and every move i make just fucks up my life even more
 in bed
 please
 where i could feel love
 i have been pretty active for the last few weeks
 maybe it will make me feel like i can feel something again
 and another car cuts in front of me and an impatient man behond who gets out of his car just to tell me off to get my vehicle out of the way afyer i just finished filling up
 walking around not really knowing where i am going or what i am doing
 i wouldn't worry about being isolated and being a waste of life
 thrown here and there patched back up by well meaning therapists
 my bank account is dwindling down to nothing since i've been unemployed for so long and the longer i'm unemployed the harder it will be to find a job
 nope
 im constantly improving myself
 i dont wanna die i just want this pain to go away and idk how much longer i can deal with it
 got routine bloodwork monthly and my hemoglobin rose a point but i am still slightly anemic
 i tried to fight it
 i been so angry
 sit next to me
 i just want to be taken seriously
 today i feel that bad feeling yesterday back
my moods are up and down
 i also create those 'worlds' where i could feel everything i want
 she said she did it because she loved me so much that she wanted a family with me
 i could drive home but the sight of my dad deteriorating on that couch just triggers me to be even more depressed
the pain is so intense right now
 i've considered terrible things today
 there is only one cure for me
 i literally lay in my room all day and live off saltines because i don't want to leave my room to cook
started building since i got up
 she diagnosed me with double depression dysthymia and mdd
 but whenever i mention feeling suicidal nobody thinks i will actually go through with it
 and absolutely nothing my name
 i have little to add of value
 i am trying to distract myself
 it'll only make it worse as i've read elsewhere
 which hold mine tightly before
 i'll miss so much school
it's just all so overwhelming and stressful to have to hear their aches and pains and fight over their own sadness when i'm sad too
 being done worrying
 i just want to go
 the joys of knowing you messed up again
 if i died today nobody would care
 have no reason to be here
 5 other kitty illnesses
 yet i'm afraid to know them further
 than to top if off i got ignored by my family tonight and that just topped the cake
 and i followed suit
 the emptiness
 i have a couple of friends but you know how it is not the same
 exhausted
 hating it
 my mother is bipolar and has become severely depressed these last few years
 i have never had that and probably never will
 i can't get work because of the nature of my crime and i can't qualify for government assistance
 i had the tv on
 and even if i came to the conclusion that i was a bad person bc of this
i don't know what i want to do
 letting myself drowning again after i sealed my source of safety away
i take long baths as my mind races against time
 because that is something god would not approve of
 she does not feel any passion anymore and she is tired
 friendships
 the pain is unbearable
 i'm just existing and i don't want to exist anymore
 i feel horrible for my scars from si
 i got dealt a terrible hand in this life and i always tried to make the most of it
last year i got seperated from my friends because my grades were too low
 the more i show pain the less they care
 without doubt i am depressed but i think it's worse then that
 i failed
 and can't even pay all of our bills
 like working at her place or another collection agency
 i should be in control of my own decisions & outcomes
i just don't want to be here
 or perform
 if i am going to try
 there is nobody who cares about me
 if you decided to not read my rant i don't blame you
 and i feel too much
 over and over again
 when everyone looks at you but no one sees you
 my digestive system is shot
all the time
 more feeling empty
being a loser in life sucks and makes me extermely suicidal
 don't amount to anything
 when i was very mentally unstable
 and i can handle a lot of stress
but it was short-lived
 i can't shift it
i've had humiliating rumours spread about me
 but the last few days have really taken there toll on me
 they didn't ask to be born to me
i've been to many doctors over the past 4 months
 it's not right and i need to stop
 so very very tired
if it's not something where i'm not parenting my kids right in the strangers mind
 but i seem to have hit a wall and sometimes it still feels like killing myself is the only option i have anymore
my latest thought is that i would have to literally move to the other side of the country to try to forget her as being where i am just constantly reminds me of her
 my mother talked right over me and yet again i feel like i don't matter to my family
 now all i can see is <insert graphic image of my suicide here>
 my crime stims from childhood and if i would have seeked helped about it
and my mom was into prostitution
i can't say the thoughts that are in my head - against the rules here - i understand why but it means they stay locked there
 and everything was on the table in front of me
 why would i lose my job
 so maybe it's not all me
 i've become a bad husband in a damaged marriage
 i also have the symptoms of borderline personality disorder
but then again
 i have no one to talk to and please dont pretend to care and say can i talk to you
as the credits rolled i found out i was smiling
 i can't do anything
 when pain outweighs suffering it's time
 i've attempted suicide twice
 there is no rhyme or reason to it
i just worry myself
 but i just couldn't shake the feelings that there's a huge wall between us now
 this is darkness that i can't escape from
 i was so happy just three months ago but then i thought
second time i left a message for them to get back to me but i fell asleep before they called back when they did my husband told them i was sleeping 
 he's moody right now and down which i understand
 my mind does not want to get better
 but i genuinely just want it to be all over
 over friendships that have changed so much
 i feel like i don't matter
 i just don't know what to do this time
 i apologized profusely this morning but this afternoon i locked myself in a room and started
 i'm confused about myself and what i'm doing and i don't want to keep going on because i feel like i can't do anything right and i feel like i'm wasting the time of everyone associated with me
 horrible nightmares
 if i violated anything i am sorry
 if anyone needs to talk i'm here so you know you're not alone
 i know my time is running out but while i'm in an okay place i don't want tiger to end it early
 however i am still really tired everyday
 i should not be here
 i react to it by abusing drugs and cutting
 but for me it's not
 i would never put them through that
 and that right now is too much for me to handle
 have not been back since and now have to go knowing the man is always there at the cafe and then kids kicked a football hitting my shoulder while carrying sick kitty in a box
 i'm tired of failing
for a moment today
 at this moment
 and then there would be humungous police business and stuff being in the spotlight
 an empty shell who hates life
 my parents should've aborted me
and i have no education or goals
there really isn't anything keeping me here
 afraid
 i was an unpaid intern with a month left to go
 but some asshole had to become jealous
 i don't have the urge
 i can't concentrate enough to work on my writing
 he basically told me that he didn't care
 i just was switched off and taking a trip down memory lane by myself in a dark room <mod edit>
 i cheated on my wife and hurt her
 insurance broker at work does not answer my emails
 my anxiety is through the roof
 last night i spent a lot of time looking into methods again
 helped volunteer
 so they still have not sorted it or told the people who collect the money so now have to try to sort that
this failure is the last drop in a glass already too full
i'm sick of needing to ask for help and support
 i feel like i no longer have a heart
 i'm just sick of this
 i'm trapped inside my head and it's giving me a panic attack that i can't shut my thoughts off when i need to function today
 to put it in a scenario
 it sucks to put it mildly
 would do things to taunt me
 it hurts so bad
 i just want this pain to go away
 i know that the pain i feel is temporary right now
 to nothing at all
 apparently that's what they call when i've been harming myself since i was 5
 i was so offended i went elsewhere
 i knew that i had to change something
 i put on a fake smile
that's why i hate living
 they tell me i'm really skinny but i just don't see it
 exist
 but today they bother me
i'm leaning to ward the second option
 glad i'm home but just drained in life
 it's cold
 on how to deal with the constant drain being in constant pain causes
i'm not sure what else to do now
 at the rate i am going
 my eldest
 i hate how it takes me ages to make a friend and even then they do more talking than me i hate how i compare myself to others and think how much of a mistake i am
but yeah
 can't do anything about this until i get the kids to school
 i have no qualms about the morality of suicide
 i don't really enjoy doing anything anymore
 nothing in my life seems to have changed
 i still can't seem enjoy anything or feel happiness
 on top of everything i was heavily bullied in school and my mum was abusive
 he would talk about me in round about tones that it made me paranoid
 so what the hell is wrong with me
 you get beat down you get back up
another thing that stops me going through with this is that i keep hoping to have some kind of 'experience'
 the thought of hurting myself became more apparent
 yesterday i woke up with a person on the phone and she asked me to stay
 nothing like that
 or sad or even somewhat happy
 i hate living
 afraid that i would get hurt later
the torment is so much
 i been sitting here thinking about writing a suicide note
 i tried to get the brain operation for deep brain stimulation but the clinical trial has been cancelled
 all i can say is that i am one ****ed up individual who does a lot of things they shouldn't
 so ill just start and you can try it for yourself
 without even realizing
 he died 4 times in front of me
recently i did several real prison tests based on psychopath testing
 i think this earth is so cool
 but it's where i am
i actually went to work today for the first time in 3 weeks
 in time i grew away from sf for my own wellbeing
 yesterday i wanted to die
 i have no idea
 i don't like talking to people about things like this
 pills didn't help
 but i think it is the depression too
i even have a tattoo dedicated to him
 why did the world have to be so cruel to me
i'm done
 i had a major breakdown
 he's brain damaged after an accident he had as a teen
i dont know if i ever put my whole story down
 but the thought of leaving breaks my heart
 hated by everyone
 i wasn't ready to lay on his chest as i always did but it not move
 and i feel like i didn't even blink
 since i have no passion or drive to excel
 to make it tougher
 i'm being paranoid and i should start loving myself and work on my thought process a little better
 all three years went to dump
i wish i could find a person similar to relate to because getting help is very hard to do
 so that i don't have to care about nobody being there for me or for my funeral
 he even told me we need help
there are many times where i wanted to commit suicide
 i thought to myself recently
i realize this is all said in my dark thoughts
 everything i am doing is worthless
 being fearful of pending doom
 i used to be very active here
 i almost feel like i hate myself for being like this
 they just stop caring about your pain
 the handyman job that supported me through college went out of business and now the internship which offered me a job was my last hope
 isn't that enough of a reason to do the right thing
 i made a thread on here and didn't get any responses
 i have suffered visual-snow for the last 3-4 years but progressed badly the last month because i drank some vodka with my brother and his friends and girlfriend
i was wrong
 i wouldn't do that
 i just got off on a tangent but i am feeling crazy right now stuck in my thoughts with no one to talk to
 i don't know what else to do
i want to talk about it to someone because i've been thinking about doing it again
 i scream
 i don't laugh
i feel trapped on all sides
 i want to die
 that was also one of the times i had a very serious suicide attempt planned
 had an abusive father and an alcoholic mother and i was always unattractive to women because of my unattractive face
 what is the point
 and online services and it wasn't worth it
my apathy and lack of care is concerning me
from here on out things will only get worse the older i get so i see no point in continuing to drag myself through this living hell
 i asked the physician who suggested i get tested
 how to feel about it
 i had hoped to be dead long ago
 each day for me is difficult because when i try to get help i feel like people are paid to help me or studying me
 i can't handle this
 i need certainty
 i am finally trying to fix it
 i cut myself off in thought with i want to kill myself
 i hate being this way
 it's been awhile since i had thoughts
 not even sure of the true reason though
 i do not necessarily make amends to those around me who i have harmed
 i am going to develop another substance abuse problem
i don't want to and can't go on like this anymore
 to their sport games and practices and out to the store when they beg to go with me
 not being able to sleep
 i still haven't learned i recently showed a glimpse of this battered useless life preserver to someone and i fear that once again i am to be betrayed
 my two bestfriends hardly speak to me and never give me the help i need
 reading the same pages while in my mind i've been justifying why i can't go
 more hysteric crying
my dad is chronically ill and i'm one of the main caretakers
 what is the point of suffering like this
 i tried that already and all i got was a lot of pain
 and realized how this nightmare is pretty much my life thus far
 the marketplace
 i had an argument with my mother
 so many ideas that i worked out
 but i am tired of emptiness and pain
 i just want to sleep peacefully and being numb forever
 hollow
 traumatic big things mixed with lots of little things are making me feel like i am hanging on by a thread and just waiting for the next thing to fuck me over
 mum would have dragged me there by my hair if i tried to refuse
 my death is extremely insignificant
 suicide crossed my mind but couldn't go further with it since i'm pregnant
 please just let me die please
 and wishing i wasn't me
 i don't know the other students in my clinic
 no one cares
 sad
i am sick of fighting
i am new here and just needed somewhere to write my feelings where i wouldn't be judged
so here i am again
 its so scary and every time i wake up after a nightmare i wake up feeling like shit and panicking and tired like i didn't even sleep or rest 
 i hate school
 as for those who aren't close to me i wouldn't have even the slightest care for
 why be here if i keep messing up
 no friends and no family
 and this trigger could be absolutely anything
 the trouble is if i ended my life
 my life just seems so
 everything is gone
why can't this stop
 today the nightmare was that he came to beat the shit out of me and rape me and i couldn't do anything to stop it then the worse part he went to rape my mom and i still couldn't protect her 
i am tired of trying things over and over
 i was ready to wait patiently for him to die for the final time
i understand it is difficult being with someone with mental illness
 immediate self preservation becomes justification for slow
 these make any small task feel huge in size and tire me out rather fast while trying to seem happy and hide behind my mask i put up to not show my true self
 the more i type the more i panic because i realize how debilitated and pathetic my life has become
i guess i'm at that point of no return
why is it that i can't seem to escape these thoughts going through my head
 been on the same medications for over a year now
 i should live
 i barely even considered what i was doing
 and i'm fighting with myself so much right now
this morning
 causes too much pain in digestive tract
 but the worse it got
nope
 i'm so scared
 i am also on government disability money
 and have very few connections
 i came back
 i want to be with him anyway possible
i feel like shit everyday
 why can't i just stop
i want to get help because of my suicidal thoughts
i now feel optimistic to get myself sorted
 i would like to wait until my parents leave this world first
 my ex used to be one of the most supportive people and now he doesn't even answer a text message from me
 i now get hidrenitis to accompany it all
 my body
 i couldn't wiggle myself out of it
 after a nasty phase of excessive partying and doing drugs
 i've been dealing with my depression & anxiety for as long as i can remember
 i don't like drinking really
 yet for some reason my brain tries to
 i feel like i would rather die than deal with facing any of it
i barely know what loneliness is
i do not know if i will commit suicide or if i will simply let my mind and body decay until i just die
 i try endlessly to block these thoughts out
 but at that very moment
 i'm empty and hopeless
 i was locked up for almost 3 years
 especially when i'm asked to show them my arms
i told people not to visit me in hospital
 i grieved his death so badly
 i'd never feel that before
 i almost feel as though i am dead inside
i hope this doesn't break rules
 most of the nightmares are about the fucker who raped me 
 because i was afraid i'd not find better
 i hate being how i been
i can get to thinking that i need to improve myself and let her see i'm strong & confident so she finds me hopefully attractive again
 nothing goes right and never has
 i just don't know when
 it's like i'm making a mountain out of a molehill
i'm trying to find reasons to hold on and to keep going but i'm coming up blank
 i am essentially a diseased mutt waiting for the day when he will be put down
 that i was too unhealthy to work i also have interstitial cystitis as well as depression and anxiety
 i feel so invisible
 to go to a therapist
 but i have to
 i've had things put in my hair
 i don't expect him to
 during this time my wife started pressuring me for another kid
 waiting for this benadryl to kick in so i can sleep
 he has nobody to turn to and is ignored no matter what he does he has been to many therapists and nothing worked
 and he told me i was 'amazing' for even trusting him enough to want to meet him
that's why i tried to reach out for help
 inside i feel nothing but agony
 i am trying to finish up this one last semester for school but i might not even have the money
 i have no disposable income to even try to do thinks i might enjoy
 they don't deserve an absent father
 he is socially isolated since birth by everyone
 and ending a life other than my own isn't something i am interested in
i tried hard to understand what is wrong with me and why no one likes me
 i haven't been the real me for 9 years
 will i always have to look over my shoulder even in broad daylight just in case someone would hurt me
whenever i sh i feel free and i get a sensation that makes me feel human but i feel like i've failed everyone
 instead of building relationships & networking much like my lack of friends i rode my bosses coattails
 the reason i am able to enter this help site is because i have hid my laptop and phone and wallet under my pillow all the time
almost broke down ordering a fucking breakfast from the deli
 i still felt isolated and it wasn't because of me
 i will never forgive my parents for bringing me into this world
i cannot bear this existence any longer
 i have been chain smoking cigarettes and it is making my chest burn
i thought about this for a while
 and have come to ask what is the point
 and already takes anti-depression tablets
 there is nothing in this world worth dragging myself through the day for
 not once
not even my cats are working ones been super affectionate today but i just can feel it
 the men here have no respect for women
 then after i spend all my money on that i still won't have a guaranteed job
 but no one i know understand how i am feeling and they cannot help me
 i feel inept in parenting and work
 but i've been clean for around a month or more
 i feel i'm running out of time to hold on - it's just slipping through my fingers as my pain and despair deepens
 i spend all day in my bedroom thinking about how if i didn't have my children i wouldn't have to be here anymore
 i want these things and don't want to give them up for good
 sometimes it's very hard to be able to cry
 he has attempted suicide many times and suffers severe depression like me
 i know i am trying to sleep so i can get up early and chat with my ldr boyfriend
i also feel like not trying
 we have to write down and post 5 positive things about ourselves or things that happened to us during that day
however i know one thing
other members will know who needs extra support today
nothing is worth it everything is so pointless
 i've already decided how and when i want to leave
 unbeknownst to him
 am i ashamed
 he's talking about someone who cares not someone who gets paid
 i attempt to give them the father they deserve
 hope that i could function in this world
 tired
 how my 'wrong' behavior makes sense because of how i was brought up
 about my depression
 it's the outline of a black heart on my wrist
 if i die then people will know
 but time after time things remind me these are unachievable dreams
 i am sorry i could not be helped
 we are trying to get her on social security but she has no income either
 pussy doormat me always caves
 isn't that a good enough excuse for going along with the screams of every cell within me that just wants to finally give up
 none of this is their fault
 sure that may make me a bad person but so what
 i was being so careful
 never to return
i want so badly to just end it all
 it just got worse everyday
 i'm still so suicidal
 it wouldn't hurt anyone
 i couldn't concerntrate
 and have realized many times over i should leave sound familiar
another thing i cannot deal with is the fact that i have to realize
no one gives a damn
 extreme bullying growing up
 pick her up
when i cry i feel like a failure because i can't just hold it in any longer
 i am chicken to off myself
 or at least not badly and i allow myself to look at the future and think of positive things and feel a little bit hopeful then something devastating happens
 i'm frustrated
the thing that hurts me the most is the fact that all of those three years of love
 doormat me stayed
 i wouldn't want to be friends with me
i have no hope for the future
 fighting for my right to be cared for
 i'm so scared and i feel so alone with these feelings
i have no friends in school or life
 the car that was in front of me left
 nobody loves me
i'm in my fifties in chronic pain and have been severely depressed for 7 years now
 this is info she wouldn't even give up
 i feel like i was never equipped with the skills to be here
 and now i feel much much worse
 i feel guilty for not being happy and wished there was a way for this pain to stop
 they all passed by as if i had never existed
 i went to the er because something in me just gave way and i needed to turn somewhere
 after checking the info on the box of condoms about failure possibilities i discovered pin holes in all of the unused condoms
so far literally nothing good has ever happened to me in this life
 this thinking sounds greedy
a few months ago
 my birthday recently passed and my only wish was to never wake up again
 i have no job for over 3 years
i know this may be a difficult question to just ask out of the blue
 leaving me with this cold emptiness
it's so ironic when someone who picked you up from misery
 i wake up tired and have to face this crappy world like that
 starting today i'm gonna stop eating unhealthy food and gonna start working out
 no other options
 do it
 i've been called names
 i wish something would happen to me to give me legitimate reasons to take the next step
quick notes spring up on my computer screen and not give myself the trouble to check how consistent they are
 i don't want to play to get fair
 i want a baby
 she asked me if i thought i could change
 to prevent myself from getting hurt
 turned the small office against me saying i was making more than them
 last night and this morning but i feel like i have hot pads on my damn feet
 the abuse
 survive
 i couldn't remember the last time i had done that
 i just don't see anything getting better
 is there something wrong with me
 i just want the damn pain to stop
 if never been a social person
 mod edit-methodsi want to stop breathing
 sometimes i wish life would get a little bit worse
 why burden everyone
 i know way too much of the things she loves and hates
 maybe i do just want to cause everyone around me the same pain i feel
 over and over i find myself thinking
 i told him how much i feel as though i'm failing
now those are 5 good things about me
 decisions have been made and i think i am ready
 it's always something i am doing wrong in life
 i was so sad at first
 i only leave the house to go to my boyfriends but i don't even want to see him anymore because i'm this depressed and i have no desire to do anything
 myself and i
 i don't want to do anything anymore
 three years later and i still have these terrible thoughts
it was around 6 months after i was brutally raped
 so why not be a bad person
 and had suicidal thoughts just as long and can't control my impulses to hurt or kill myself under stress
 still very tired
 and it only made it worse
 i need some advice on my situation
 i was alone since the beginning
 being miserable and dragging my wife down
 but am having difficulties
 but it wouldn't bother me all to much
i tried to confide in him how i felt
 i spend my evenings and weekends doing pretty much nothing
 tired of existing
 and i don't like it
 i don't care if the people around me suffer or how they feel or anything along those lines
 i'm crying as i type and trying not to be too loud since i'm crashing at the apartment of some friends
i don't want to get into too much detail
recently i am always having trouble with self harm
i'm sick of not being greatful for what i do have
 i have been single for two years now and am so sick of it
 i am not worthy
 no car
 i have been feeling horrible inside for years
 sick of it all
 and she scold me for not telling her what my dad had asked me to do
i'm just miserable right now
if i tell my boyfriend will i just freak him out and push him away
 plus i have no evidence to the contrary
 i make way too much money to be this poor as a software engineer
 they pulled me up
 no one could tell and i was very discreet about how i was feeling
 though i have to to work
 i tried to bury myself in distractions and play many different sports as well as many hours of video games
one failed attempt already
 and i know i don't want to be away from him
 i have to beg for everything and i have to sit by while my wifes condition gets worse
 it would probably be me slowly reducing how much time i have them until i rarely have them at all
 not sure i can't take this pain any more
 all i can think about is ending it
 she actually brought in the knife to my room ready to strike
 my pcp is up the street
 sure it would mean suffering for my friends and i would prefer them to make it out of that situation unharmed physically and mentally
i don't need much attention though
 the only thing i've gotten out of these are side effects that i'd rather not be dealing with
 i hate how no matter what people say to me or do to help me: i always think and feel like no-one cares about me
 one grandparent had clinical depression and the others were all pretty removed from friends etc
 tried to understand why people don't like me
 and since then i managed a trip to the store because i needed bread for the next days
 i lost my job because of this
 i constantly wish a terminal illness would strike me down
i dress up in fursuits to look like a dog
 i've been pushed
but it did happen
 i never wanted to do anything
 i find it hard to deal with
 she knew i was not well and now she treats me with stupidity and coarseness
 my outlet turned to self-gratification
 something in me tells me just do it
 it really just felt good to know i was damaging myself though
 he said it never got passed a few make out sessions
 i already said sorry and they said everything was okay
 he was tired of hearing it
i think it scared me to realise how close i had come & how it's not the answer
 because my anxiety skyrockets in social situations
 i have also thought about just leaving and not looking back
 always looking over my shoulder
 i feel scared of what i could do
 i just wish to die soon
 but i don't think it would bother me at all if that were to happen to the school i attend
 i delegated so much i don't feel i know how to do my job well anymore
 loser
 and i have never felt so helpless
 i have chased them up about it to work out the right amount
 i have a culinary degree but owe tons of money in loans that are in default
 i want to say no but it's hard
 anyways
 i don't want to die but i'm being pushed into it by other sides of me
sorry to make another topic so soon but im at work right now and i cant handle this
and is not so much that i actually want to die but to change the situation
i have no life no friends just emptiness inside
 that's why i'm being very careful with whoever tried to get close to me
but i get these suicidal thoughts in my head
 i really try not to use it as a crutch
that it would be so much easier if i no longer existed
last year i ended up graduating and getting my bachelors in information technology
 over the years it has dragged me down mentally and physically
 i am sick to death of being a hideous zit-backed midget failure of a waste of life
 i don't have any second thoughts on doing it anymore
 and the though of disappointing & hurting loved ones that have kept me from seriously exploring it
 i can't make less but i make more than i deserve and could make elsewhere
 remember when
 so i assume he's telling the truth
 i feel like a monster
 but i don't
 i feel like i truly am lost
 not one event but almost all events that just keep spiraling down hill
 but had to take him off life support that night
 nothing serious but damn
 at all
 self harming
 unable to change p-doctors and bad case management finally broke me to the point of not caring anymore about anything which has ended up sticking with me until now
 i am the biggest loser
it's not enough that i'm fat ugly and alone
 i was supposed to be the future
 won't work
 i had suffered in silence
 thoughts of suicide crossed my mind
 the biggest set off right now is just pain
 i feel so alone and confused
 i feel his love for me is nothing more than a friends but yet he yet he says
 if i can't support my family financially or emotionally
 i know it will damage my health
 just breaking down over worrying about going to school or completing the simplest of tasks
 i feel guilty for treating people like therapists or treating them like they should have to listen to me vent because it feels whiny and i hate the feeling i get when i vent to friends
 everyone about whom i care
 just feel stuck and tired with my thoughts
cbt therapy started last year after almost a year of trouble trying to get help with mental services here where i live
 and i keep think it will fail
 these suicidal thoughts can be so overbearing sometimes that i just want to break down and cry and usually i do
 being alone all the time
 when all i want to do is lye down and ease the pain
 meditation didn't help
 i know some of my closer friends can definitely see what's going on but i don't feel comfortable enough to explain what's going on with me yet
 but decided there is no point
 yet i'm too afraid to put myself behind the wheel
 i get hardly any likes
 so hard
 where i live you have to get on the highway to get everywhere
 ideally i've wanted to air out my mind to strangers but i've never known what to do specifically because not everyone really wants to hear someone's complaints
 yet in the end i can not help myself
 i feel jealious
 why can't i just say no and let that be that
 hoping these thoughts pass soon
 i don't think of myself as a bad person in anyway for having these thoughts although a lot of people may
 it's against my beliefs to commit suicide and i know ending my life is not the answer because it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem
 i can't take this anymore
 both the sh and the anxiety and my avoidance behavior
 i cannot cope with the fact that my world
 i can't fail when i try
 the worthlessness that i feel
 don't get me wrong i wouldn't do it myself or help the cause but i don't think i would care much if i saw that happening all before my eyes
i feel like i'm borderline invisible
 he said i'm very special to him today though
despite those boo-hoo's
i just realized what today was
i'm struggling still from last night i had hopes that some sleep and a new day would change maybe improve it even just a little bit
 so pathetic
 please even share your thoughts with me or if you have any advice
 and they feel far outweighed by the bad
 i even stopped drinking
 i know too many details about her interests
 have i screwed up so bad
 i didn't think i could afford a divorce
 i'm not even living
 well i'm sort of having nightmares
 and now i'm left friendless
 i have nobody to talk to and everything i own is getting broken to the point of being unfixable
 i can see clearly that i have lots and lots of reasons to keep fighting and to stay here
 but i don't wanna play anymore
 but i know i can't live with this pain anymore
lately i've been feeling ugly and useless
 but never really had any friends
 i feel like i live at the vets
 i'm about to take something for it soon
 if i could go back i wish i would have taken better care of me heart
 i read other posts and can relate so strongly to the unbearable pain and fatigue
 i don't really keep friends because they've always been more trouble than they're worth
 everytime i think i hit bottom i fly off a cliff and down another mountain
 i sit here in constant pain
every single step that i take in this world reminds me of her
 the t just follows me everywhere i go
i need help
 i'm only a burden to my wife for instance for many reasons
 being treated like garbage
 when i confronted him he apologized to me and said she told him we were separated and getting a divorce
 my parents all blame stuff on me
 i woke up from a nightmare
i feel like he's stating the truth and than another part of me doesn't believe him cause i suffer with lots of trauma in my life and i want to be happy
 next plan would probably be to divorce and do joint custody
 i truly feel trapped
 right now i am going through a rough patch
 it has decayed and broken to a point where recovery is simply impossible
 it would drive me actually insane
now i don't care anymore
 the piece of shit that i feel
 i understand that's the easy way out
 everything is my fault
as a child i was always described as a sad and angry child
 i have been emotionally scarred and to make it even worse
 i refuse to take pills and go to a doctor who views me as just another prescription
 i know someone must be wondering why
 because there is no better way to describe them
 i feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way but all i want tonight is to join him
 too
my husband took his life a little over a month ago
 i've managed to get through a couple storms so far this spring with minimal negative repercussions but i guess i can't dodge all of them
 nothing works
 i was so messed up lately that i just went off for a week or so just to get away from it all
i am tired all the time
 feeling so overwhelmed by everything and i just cant take it
 before having kids
i have been listening to prince all night
 so lonely
 this time i did leave
 or what to do
i'm tired of fighting
 they haven't allowed me to eat or drink anything for the whole day
i don't know if i am straight
had a sort of breakdown in class today
 i was told i was anemic in august
 this time i have a plan so i should really tell somebody before its too late
 online is so toxic - everywhere everyone seems to be going through one thing or another
 and do all the right things
 a piece of shit
 i want to be here for the future when my boyfriend can move here and we can build all the things i never had
 how do i raise a child when half of me is gone
 unemployment is still tough here yet i know i have to try
 i won't lie
 as i have posted here before
 my mind
 i can't do those things in peace anymore
 and the letters 'mj' which is also a shortened version of my real name in red
 never have i been closer to anyone
 i was so numb
 its been pounded into my head that is the wrong thing to do
 but this was one of my worst attempts
 i'll never amount to anything
 i feel like i don't deserve to be sad or upset because i don't rightfully have any room to complain about my life or life in general
 he has no idea what he means to me
i knew it's my fault
since last year my life has become meaningless to me for many reasons
 that she will be with someone else
 my chest hurts
 this crisis of mine began about three months ago
 i am just cold and numb inside
 i hate how pointless it all feels
 she doesn't want to hear it
 i still feel very lost
 at least
 i hate life 
 it is so scary
 this made me socially awkward and gave me extremely low self-esteem
 i can't stop crying about it
 i just have this huge void where my feelings used to be and all that's left is this overwhelming sense of despair and i just cannot cope any more
 but was he right
 but i want to stay and make it work
 all my dreams crushed or impossible
 but does anyone have any advice
i tried to ignore them
thursday he's getting a second scan of his brain since one they did recently was inconclusive and we're both pretty worried
 i am of absolutely no use to anyone
 i'm scared that they'll put me in some kind of mentally ill hospital or something and i'm not sure i like the sound of that
 i don't have a job to go to
 i don't know what to do
after several suicide attempts
 when i die
i can't live with this anymore
 thinking that it's not cheating if there's no sexual relationship that you're cheating on
hazel
 by becoming emotionally dead
 i don't want to be labelled - but then this is the only way to get help it seems
 they really broke me
 out of nowhere
 i can't hold in the pain of feeling forgotten
 i understand his side of this
 i wish this would all go away but i can't leave this earth because i'm the only one my mom has
 but i'm getting there
 i go out of my way to try and hang out with people where i live now and i continuosly get shut down
 seeing as we are near bankrupt
i know there is no concrete answer to this question or none of us would be on this forum right now
 i have to be ready to go soon
 it's next to impossible
 i am a loser who sits home and drinks and smokes weed all day because i have nothing else going for me
 the most disgusting lowest scum
 i know this is very selfish of me and i know this is silly
 but i guess it is time when it has to end
anyway
 without trying
 i sort of stopped fearing pretty much anything
i've realized that there are so many things that i don't like about my life
 but nothing ever changes
i wonder what will fuck me up next
 i can't ever see the end of this
 i don't want to sound like i am crying out for attention
 honestly i don't really care if i die or not - i just want to attempt suicide and see what fate chooses for me
 i know there are factors leading into this
 because we're digging into a lot of tough things before i am starting dbt
 just hoping that when i wake up tomorrow the feeling will go away or at least be lessened
 i am undergoing therapy right now
 i was just out getting some food for the house and dreaded every second i was out
 and have come to realize that i got married because that's what i was supposed to do
 so why can't i just leave
 i still have absolutely nobody to talk to
so i think to try it out as ive been told it suppose to sort of help
we get no money it will be my fault
 i don't know about my family but i think they don't care
 but then i feel trapped here
 they never really cared about how i feel
 i just needed a change of scenery
 noisily
i've been having a really hard past months
 no support
 because acting is all i'm good at and all i've ever wanted to do
 usually i do not hear them
 but then i need the help
 i'm scared to reach out on my sleepless nights to my friends that say they are here for me
 i see the path forward yet so frequently walk backwards
 i hate to post again
i feel weird tonight
 i'm even scared to ask for a new textbook or even to walk into assembly
 can't throw myself into my favorite past time
 i feel like no one gives a shit about me and i don't give a shit about myself anymore
my life has probably been more difficult than some and easier than others
too much on my mind
 i start therapy and probably meds soon but even if this helps i feel betrayed
*just thought i'd get that off my chest
 you should start losing weight and get rid of this thing you really hate about yourself so 
it will become too much
 i don't talk to anybody
i don't even know why im trying to hold on
 i just want to end it all
 that would hurt even worse
 i am turning our relationship into a toxic one
i wouldn't have to study for finals
 i hate feeling like this but i hate myself and everything about myself
 to listen to me
 i did have some support for a short while but it seems that this was temporary
 i've lost all motivation to do anything at all
 i don't want to learn anything new
 maybe i am this fatigued from the anemia
 i took a month off
 a nobody
 i should have left her then
 someone who accept me and my problems
 when i get there today they call me up and tell me they don't take my insurance and ask me to leave
 but i have my kitties
 i'm at work
 we do have a cheap rental lined up though
i think what stops me from ending this life
 i want something to happen to me so that i can just die already
 but i wasn't sure
my mind is a mess
 i'm scared of death
 im tall
 one friend is all i could ever ask for
 or even just a stranger's kind word
 becasue trust me
 anytime i think it is starting to i fall apart again and i'm tired of being in this much pain
 i find myself telling small lies to him as he asks me why do i bother seeing him if i want to die so badly
 i'm angry that he's in the ground and i'm up here
 that may be wrong now that i think about it
 i was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and given a cpap to use
 i now have a full plan of how it all will end
 i've been like this for years and it always comes back to feeling this way
i'm never going to change
 but it gets harder to live each day
i don't know what i should do
 and blood dripping down my arm from them
 so if the tests were positive i would refuse treatment - which means there is nothing to be accomplished by having the tests
medications for me have varied from doing nothing to worse then to somewhat okish
 i'm only fifteen
 no reason to be here
 groin
 i am merely just existing
 so i know my wife can figure things out and eventually find a new husband
 and it was before my back problems and surgeries to try and fix the problem had started
 but when i got here
 is getting a new one starting soon
i wouldn't have to deal with intrusive memories and intrusive thoughts
 it was of a little girl saying 'i feel really
 but i don't have many drugs available and i think cutting on an ongoing basis is like slow suicide
 again
i know that compared to everyone else who is struggling with suicide
 perhaps i just looked for treatment too late
 i am 5 months pregnant with our second child and it has not gotten any easier
 substance abuse
looking at a day filled with people who don't give a shit about me
can't take this pain right now
 feeling like i wanted to kill myself
 the pain
 maybe i'll just run away to italy
 but my mum doesn't like the idea
 i can't stand the idea of keeping a general because i'm so critical of saying or thinking negative/sad things it makes me cringe
 but i won't get to see all the places on my planet because i'm doubtful i'll come into a large sum of money
 i wouldn't stop the suffering even if i could
 if it's not severe pain in my lower back
 i've dealt with low self esteem
 that maybe my heart is telling me to die
 can only deal with the yard in small pieces
 as long as i'm alive at least i have a choice
 lately i have just wanted to hurt myself and cause myself pain
 because i want a baby and to be back home
 and so it's no use trying
 in october my dad returned home and decided to quit his job on disability leaving us with no income and no health insurance
i can't do anything
 i can not walk at night because i can't see
 etc
 i'm so tired of it its making me lose my mind 
i have a person in my life
 and my body hurts
i was recently sexually assaulted by a neighbour and am scared to even go out
 i'm expected to keep the business going by getting work
 not just barely two hours before she wanted to meet up
 it's really a logical next step given everything i've tried and been through with no results
 i had 3 methods lined up even
 what stops me
 i've had my things stolen
e's and f's and i feel like a failure because i'm not getting the grades i used to
 asthma gets in the way
i don't know what i'm doing
 she begged me to come back for the kids
 everything
i was committed into a psych ward for suicide 8 years ago for 4 days
 meeting my rapist over and over again
 yet i hate every moment of it
 that fucked me up
 i escaped my abusive parents
fucking hate life
 what used to be on this earth years before us
 i don't want to be a father
everything screams
 who i saved and could not leave so they save me from suicide too
 he would find me on busses
5 years into a depression that feels like it's just taken over my life
 i would be at peace then
 i'm exhausting emotionally in dealing with anything really
but all i want to do is to say goodbye
 i now look back at decisions i've made and mistakes that seem so stupid
 it's just another hurdle
 recently i got my report back and found that some of my grades are lower than some people's grades who are in lower classes than me
 because i will be permnantly gone
 i am afraid
 and it is all my fault
 if i have the disease and do nothing about it
i hate how i'm so quiet and shy that people pick on me as they know i won't try to defend myself
 i would probably attempt to survive out of instinct at the time but i looking at it now and after the event itself it would mean nothing to me
 frankly
 i lost my job; and at some point i will be homeless
 i want to stop that feeling
 it didn't help
 except he has absolutely no idea
 the only person i really trusted
 and taking them won't get rid of the tinnitus
 another reason i stopped taking them
 to me
 i just needed to whine i guess
 i have done a lot of counseling already and i just can't seem to get better
 i then proceed to ruin my life and my wifes life
 if not then i'm scared
 i don't want to be alive but i have no specific plan of my own i just have the wish
 and how little she seems to value our time by repeatedly doing this to us
 most days i can't stand listening to 'man in the mirror'
 and not one cares for my well-being or cares in general
 i will simply toss aside the advice they give me and go on with my misery
the truly frustrating part is that i've done all of this to myself
for the last two years i've been horribly fatigued
 i was doing everything to push it to the back of my mind & ignore it
 i am gay and engaged but i feel like i'm lost and trapped
 is so demoralising and depressing for me
 i cannot feel any hope anymore
 i laughed and said
 i think what happened is that i coasted
 i think about suicide
 but instead ive become the problem
 i wish i could just not exist anymore
 my new year is way too young and i can't connect to them emotionally
 i earned this
 i like my job
i've thought of leaving
blegh
 it causes me black and white spots like tv static in the visual field and disturbances in evenings when this is most notable
 i look fat
 i'm the last person to kill myself
i want out
 i must make that feeling go away
 shortly into our relationship she pressured me into not using condoms saying it'll feel better and that she's on birth control
but i'm 37
everyone in my life always seems to leave in the end
 my heart has been ripped out
 i can see why but it really really upsets me
 i'm just here
 she was my priority
 the harder it is to fight
 typically when i feel like shit i try not to vent it at all to her and look for alternatives because i don't want to condition her into expecting depressing stuff out of me when i message her
 because my company is becoming less financially viable as i'm not bringing in the work
 it just came on after a conversation with a work-friend who was doing things with his life
 even though i'm all alone
usually its very difficult to effect me so deeply that i'm terrified
 which i want nothing but revenge so badly it hurts
 how long will i have to live
 it feels like my logic brain is still sedated
 all it took was turning that corner
 they never take you seriously until you harm yourself
 single and deeply unhappy
 it's this part that acts first when i'm met with triggers and bad memories
 i'm new here
 i have no friends or family
 you can tell a person who's depressed and lonely that it may get better
 i know i messed up because i have to pay for it everyday for the rest of my life
 i didn't want any more kids and i surprisingly held my ground
 sorry if it does
 and here i am
 that just wants to scream and throw stuff and hurt my body to get all these horrible emotions out
lately
 i didn't even move
 but i wasn't thinking too clearly when i got it
 i was realizing begging the angels to take me away wasn't enough any more
 he reminds me of how i was when i was his age
i'm alone
 i am rapt with anxiety about this
 so what happened
 he watches movies all day and complains of how hopeless and depressed he feels
 over the years i have found that talking over problems has very very little affect on me in helping in shape or form
 then i can seconds later think it's all hopeless & i have to do away with myself as i can't cope with the pain of not being with her
 i kinda have this calmness surrounding me
 she will do things that i always wanted to do with someone else
my problem i suppose is that i have many physical curses
every day i dread waking up because i know that i will have to fight the urge to want to kill myself all day long
 and ruin my family further
 and i can't handle it
