 you're like a hamster in bed
 i'll set that bitch on fire
 does anyone want chinese food
 even the people asking for money have ipods
 go see the circus
 you're just jealous
 for just matches
 new york is the best country in the world
 you know she has add
 it's like seeing one in their natural habitat
 that shit gives you wings
 i only ask you for some spare change
 which you're not 
 you look like a scarecrow standing there
 i would be delighted
 that's all right
 i see you will be engaged by the end of the year
 you know what she did
 jdate makes you straight
 so during the american revolution
 there was the human sacrifice
 it's still early
 you 420 friendly
 how many times can you watch a line of women lifting their legs at the same time
 panties are for girls
 what're you gonna do
