Bad day,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/bad-day.122599/,"actually bad week, I just need to vent. I'm so tired of this depression and anxiety, I felt good for awhile then I wake up one morning back to square one.  Dark depression and anxiety to the point I don't want to leave the house and can't get anything done. I wish I were normal, when I look at the problems ""normal "" people have I'm envious, some of them are laughable. They would probably think my irrational fears are laughable too. That's what makes it so damn frustrating, there's nothing outside to be afraid of (except a public panic attack) I'm tired of no motivation, everything looks/feels empty and futile, the same idiotic daily grind day in day out. I'm sure it'll pass......sooner or later.....sooner I hope. I know there's no answers, just wanted to complain with a post. I hope everyone is doing better than I am today, you're all good people and I'm sorry you suffer this curse of depression/anxiety and all the other mental tortures that have descended on you.

Love you, bless you, 

Brian"
No replies necessary,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/no-replies-necessary.122638/,"I went into a crisis center on Friday afternoon and spent two hours talking to a therapist.  I told her if she started to write an m1 hold I would leave at the start of our session.



 She was the best therapist I have had since seeking treatment.  She was angry that I had talked my way out holds in mid-march.  She told me my charm and the kindness of therapists was not helpful for me.



She was too good.  Always had a counter argument, outmaneuvered me consistently, forced me to see how damaging my own words were.  She broke me down.  



She wrote the hold and I eventually left before police could arrive to stop me. 



 She told me multiple times that I need time for myself, that I was not getting better and should allow others to care for me for a little while.  I was terrified at the thought.



Right now I am unstable after a better day Saturday.  I won't have anyone to talk to, maybe for awhile which is the main cause.  Future worry but I know how I get when there are gaps in therapy. Hell I'm not doing so great right now.  



The weird thing is that I work in mental health.  I see therapists, nurses and prescribers every day.  But I also have lots of conflict due to some of these people being aware that I am in treatment.  That also creates anxiety due to privacy concerns.  



This therapist called my office today and even though she did not say it, I know she recognized my voice.  



Ive been tearing up at my desk for hours now.  This lack of anonymity, along with the reasons I went into that specific crisis center are making me feel panicked.  



I need to talk but Tuesday may be the earliest I will see my current T. 



That's as much as I write for now and I hope it is enough"
"Oops, I Manipulated Someone",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/oops-i-manipulated-someone.121864/,"Recently, I was conversing with a friend of mine. She had been committing self-harm, and I had been trying to talk her out of it. Eventually, she realised what she was doing wasn't the way to go about things (not a serious case, this was simply a teenage drama, so it was quite easy to push her through).



I get the bus home, I'm feeling good, I go up into my room and started vibing to some Gorillaz, then I get a text.



""I hate you""

""What?""

""It just sunk in""

""Still confused""

""You're hideous Matthew""

""I mean, yeah, but can you tell me what's up?""

""Stop!""

""Did your boyfriend (yes, she had a ""boyfriend"", as much as you can have one at my age, pathetic really) show you a picture of me killing a puppy or something? I can assure you, I only eat the ones from the butchers""

""SHUT UP!""



So I did just that, i shut up.



As you can probably tell, I was pretty weirded out, she'd seemed fine no more than 5 minutes ago... What had got her panties in a twist. Low and behold, no less than 30 seconds after putting my phone down, I get a call.



I hear a gruff, male voice on the other side of the phone.



""Hello,is this Matthew Barbara? (yes, he said barbara)""

""No, it's his cousin Steve""

He paused for a bit, ok, so he wasn't that much of a worry intelectually.

""Don't play your games with me kid. I know what's going on.""

""Sorry sir, but I have no idea what you're talking about.""

""I know what you've been doing, kid. You've been head****ing my daughter!""

""Uh. sir-""

""STOP HEAD****ING MY DAUGHTER!""

I heard crying in the background.

""Have a good day you manipulative little freak!""



It's now been a week, and I haven't seen this friend anywhere, they don't answer their phone, every contact I had with her has been blocked. And now I'm kind of like.



Whoops"
Stupid,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/stupid.122569/,"I am sitting at my desk trying to calm myself down and hating myself for being STUPID. And normally when I say stupid I am talking about some emotionally driven decision or action - and I am that kind of stupid on an almost perpetual basis. I have basically come to terms with being 'that kind of stupid'.



The kind of stupid that reduces me to tears of frustration and self loathing is the ""HOW CAN YOU NOT FUCKING GET THIS?!"" kind of stupid. Usually involving some kind of math/data. I hate that I can't work it out for myself - I HATE that I don't get it when someone explains it to me and it still makes no sense and I really really hate it when I make the person that is trying to so frustrated and annoyed with me for NOT getting it that they tell me I ""don't need to understand it - I just need to do it"".



So if I have something that costs Â£35 and I want to make a 65% margin I need to take my Â£35 and divide it by 0.35. Â£35/0.35 = Â£100. Fine. But if I sell it for Â£70 I have made 100% profit. My MD tells me that GP (gross profit) is the SAME as margin. How can that be true. If my profit is 100% but my margin in that instance would be 50%???



I am not really expecting anyone to explain this to me - apparently I am far too fucking stupid to understand if you try. Believe me, people have tried. I just really needed to vent before I cry at my desk."
My best friend,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/my-best-friend.122325/,"I first met my best friend in... I think it was 2005.  She was the new kid nobody knew and I was the weird kid nobody liked, so we were pretty much destined to pair up on the first project of the school year.  We hit it off pretty much right away and were best friends throughout middle school until she moved about 350 miles away from where I lived at the time.



We remained best friends through high school by texting, connecting on Facebook and writing each other long letters.  She occasionally came to visit my hometown with her family.  I'd see her at those times.  Through most of my rocky college experience leading up to my move, we stayed close (although I felt reluctant to tell her about depression and suicidal feelings like I did before.)  That was when things changed.



When I was planning my move to San Francisco, I was really nervous.  This was a huge step in my life, and I wanted her to know about it.  So I texted her about it.  I didn't tell her specifically to keep it a secret, but it was kind of a given, considering the things I mentioned about my parents.



I don't remember how long after that the next part happened, but it couldn't have been more than a few days.  My parents received a phone call at approximately 11pm, maybe later.  I knew something was wrong right away.  My parents told me the next morning that it had been my best friend's mom saying that my best friend had told her I was planning something drastic.  My parents asked me a few things.  I confirmed nothing and denied suicide plans.  Later I found out my parents had lied and knew of my upcoming move.  I asked my best friend about it and she said her mom must have gone through her phone.  I found out she'd lied too, and she said she wasn't sorry.



We stopped talking after that for a while until my counselor at the residential treatment program encouraged me to forgive her.  Things were a little rocky at first, but we got back to being best friends soon enough.  Now I'm struggling in my relationship with her again.



She's just so busy, she hardly has time to talk to me.  I find it hard not to be upset at that.  (Even though I know it's not really her fault.)  Plus there's at least one other person she calls her ""best friend"".  It might seem silly, but I sometimes feel slighted when I see that on Facebook.  I feel like maybe we could grow apart and I don't want that to happen.  Sometimes I feel like she's only tolerating me, but that's probably just my low self-esteem talking...



I'm going to be moving within 300 miles of where she is soon, but I get the feeling that no matter how close I get she'll still have trouble finding time to see me."
nothing,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/nothing.122395/,"i feel like garbage, trash, a big pile of nothing. I am no good. I am pathetic and don't even stand up to my own core principles. I am nothing, when I look in the mirror I see an empty husk who is nothing.

A few frustrating days,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/a-few-frustrating-days.122436/,"Just venting - 



I'm easily pushed over my tolerance levels anymore.  I'm trying to get better and I am, but sometimes things can send me into an anxiety-filled frenzy that is difficult to come out of.  It can feel like it won't end.



Once the anxiety raises then all else spirals.  Triggers come unexpectedly and without me knowing what or why.



And times like this, I feel alone and sad and pathetic.  It is exhausting.  And all of this I would like to end.



That's all.

"Endless depression cycles, suicidal ideation. I want relief.",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/endless-depression-cycles-suicidal-ideation-i-want-relief.121822/,"I have more than most, a loving relationship, nice pets, and a nice apartment in a beautiful city, but I always come back to this debilitating depression. I can't even walk out the door to go buy paper towels and dish soap. 



I feel hopeless, unable to change focus from all of the pending threats in my life, inevitable death of loved ones, losing money, having to always work and never being able to catch up or earn enough stability to have children, in hopes of having someone and something bigger than myself to live for and to see something beautiful, and focus on passing on the good things I've learned and value in myself. 



I'm unable to forgive my dysfunctional upbringing, my mother who made me take care of her in alcoholism and drug abuse, who even after 15 years clean, struggles financially and in loneliness and illness, putting weight on me as the only one to care for her. I'm unable to forgive my younger brother, who I thought my best friend in our shared experience of surviving our dysfunctional family, but who instead has turned into a sociopath and narcissist, who cut me out of his life without empathy or explanation. 



I feel myself in post trauma, and tread so carefully in the friendships I've made as an adult, but know I cannot help but come off as needy, or sensitive, or smothering. I can only distract myself from my own suicidal ideations by throwing myself into helping others with resumes and job searches, listening and advising to their stories, which seem so trivial in comparison to mine, but I feel some minor relief in pretending that my problems are that small and solvable...i feel some minor relief in pretending that I'm valuable to somebody, even if they just are using me for help now, and have no real interest in having an deeper friendship with me.



I feel such anxiety not knowing if I'm hated. or if people harbor resentment toward me for something I've done and am not aware of.... I'm so depressed. I'm so sad. I don't want to burden the few loved ones I have. I can't bare to see happy families who have vacations, and peers who visit their home towns and post images of dinners and respect and memories between siblings.



I can't even connect with others who suffer from depression, because theirs seem entirely biological or chemically-based. They cycle through doctors and medication and I cannot relate because there do not seem to be any real events they can list as long and terrible as mine. I've tried medication, was misdiagnosed as several contrasting disorders by different doctors who didn't even attempt talk therapy, or to learn about my life. They just asked 10 questions and dolled out the meds, which caused me to have hives, wet the bed while I slept, made me feel like I was having seizures, and other unnatural experiences. I KNOW the only thing I would be interested in is talk therapy, but the thought of trying to leave the house to meet so many disappointing mismatched therapists until I find one I can trust and respect seems impossible. I feel tortured. 



I can't take this anymore. Life is full of disappointment and empty gestures, of unreciprocated love, and disrespect and dispiriting of women as they are, and as they age. It seems like there's no hope or anything to look forward to. I've made it to my 30s... I thought I just had experiential trauma from all of the dysfunctional family relationships growing up, I thought I would outgrow this as a teenager, as a college student under high stress, as an adult considering children and a future...but I didn't. I'll always feel this way. I'll always want to die."
Why do I feel responsible for my toxic family?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why-do-i-feel-responsible-for-my-toxic-family.121941/,"I feel like I have always been taking care of them, ever since I was a kid. I am the peace maker and basically I make sure they don't kill one another. My mom is always drunk and puts me and everyone else down, even sometimes while sober. She always needs to be the center of attention and to be involved in some sort of drama. I can't imagine how many times I have told her to drop and forget about something from the past, about me or another family member, or even a friend or a neighbor, only for her to bring it up once again. 



My mom told me I never do anything, but I do so much. If I didn't take out the trash, do the dishes, clean the house, even her own room, it would never get done because she never does any of it. I left her alone for a week once, and she couldn't even take out a single bag of garbage! The place looked like a trash heap when I got back there. Not to mention, she thinks that I am being influenced by ""bad"" people, and referred to my friends as ""assholes"" even though she knows none of them! I call it like I see it. I try to give her a reality check, but she gets offended. She says I'm not allowed to discuss my feelings with anyone. If I paint a less than perfect picture of her, that's a problem, but I only speak the truth. And it's not like I can talk to her about these things, because she just won't listen.



So....why do I feel responsible for my family? I guess I would feel guilty if something bad happened to them, but that would be of their own doing. I can't imagine why I put up with it, unless I am just that defeated from years of mental/verbal abuse that I just accept it now."
Yarp.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/yarp.122093/,"Feeling exceptionally depressed. I don't really know how to cope. I haven't been talking to anyone specifically about my depression lately, except for my counselor every 2 weeks, and I haven't been talking to anyone in general, really. Overall, I just feel truly lonely. I could talk to my family, but to me, for various reasons, they're a last resort. Monitoring my diet is losing it's effectiveness in distracting me from my suicidal thoughts; it's just frustrating now. Exercise just feels like drudgery--go figure. I feel like things will only get worse from now on. I've had this ambition to at least pointlessly make it past another birthday, even though it's just another shitty day. In spite of all this, I've yet to self-harm since December. What am I doing...?"
Pained and Vulnerable (abuse triggers),https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/pained-and-vulnerable-abuse-triggers.122653/,"Compared to the weekend this is nothing I suppose... 



But I'm just miserable. 



My sick back is acting up, being worsened by mother natures cure to most females... which in turn hurts in itself, and is causing me mood swings. 



I am just having some weird thoughts on top of it... I am listening to a Prince song called 'Free'. I listened to it a lot when I was working my way away from my 'ex' idiot who abused me and forced me into prostitution... 



It has some really powerful lyrics, to me at least... and in my world 'The lonely monster' became my ex... 



And slowly I clawed myself back to life from a zombie like state... a state where I mindless followed his orders, too tired to even question it inwardly... I didn't sleep for days... Late at night, on top of it all he made me work on a site where I had to talk to horny men with all sorts of weird ideas in their heads and entertain them for money...). 



I wasn't even a human being at that point... I was a robot... a slave... and still now he can instill fear in me. 



But I got out. Thanks to my amazing boyfriend. He truly saved my life, and he's build me up from the bottom. I am a person now. I am a woman who can think for myself, and no man has control of me... my boyfriend refuses to make any decision for me... he's the complete opposite of the idiot. 



I just hate that I allowed that to happen... That I let that lonely monster take control of me. 





And another thing... that time of the month always feels a little extra weird for me... (sorry if squeamish guys are reading along) but my period was irregular for years... I saw my doctor about it, had my hormones tested... I worried it was PCOS, but it wasn't... however my doctor told me when I was 20 that I might not be able to conceive, or at least struggle with it... Since I was very young I've had this big dream to have children... well, I haven't talked to a doctor about it since then... but currently I'm regular like clockwork... so it does make me hopeful... 



In a way I think my period might be a trigger too, from when I was raped at 13... I was late, and I was so worried I had become pregnant. (no one knew what had happened). It was a relief when I finally got it... but it had been weeks of bad dreams waking up feverish thinking I was pregnant or had a baby, or even miscarried. I can still remember a very vivid dream of that. 





Ah well. I'll survive, I guess. I just need to pig out on some ice cream and chocolate. Right?"
Ugh just ugh,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/ugh-just-ugh.122666/,"I've had a not very nice tooth ache most of the day. My mood the last few days has been dipping more and more.

I don't know him very well at all. 



I don't even want to do anything anymore I just want to curl up and rott away in my unit. I don't want people to need me and I don't want to need others either. 

I feel so pathetic as a human I have done nothing useful for anybody or for myself. I have nothing.



I tried to have a bath because I don't have one at home but all I could do was stress. 



I really really don't want to do this thing called life anymore but I can't do anything about it at my friends house anyways

Having a good day is scary,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/having-a-good-day-is-scary.122022/,"So I woke up at 6 am, my alarm was set to 7.50... but I think the sunrise might have woken me... I went to the bathroom without turning the light on; I hoped I could crawl back to bed... I had only had 5 hours of sleep (well 'only' is relative when some nights I only get 2 or less)... but as I washed my hands I saw a weird shadow... I guess my eyes weren't awake yet... I panicked and ran to turn on the light... I had to hide in the bathroom where it was now light... gasping for air, my heart racing... 

an hour later I went back to bed... I sat on the edge first... but fear gripped me again... I sometimes get afraid of the 'monster' under the bed grabbing my legs... yes. I am 26 and I have those irrational fears sometimes still... 



I turned on my computer and the sun came up... it became a very bright and sunny day... and suddenly I just felt completely okay... 

I got my coffee and Greek yogurt... writing and joking with my boyfriend who came online at 8... and suddenly I realized I was having a really, really good day. I didn't feel the dark cloud over my head that has followed me for so long... and especially since the last time I saw my therapist... 



I have been so tired... so depressed... I have barely been able to keep my eyes open... and the last two days I have cried every ten minutes... I even cried as I fell asleep last night. 



I got my laundry done... I even went outside while waiting for it to finish... soaking up the sunshine and I laughed at how pale my skin is after this winter and my anxiety keeping me inside. 



Everything just felt normal and okay... and I feel like I can get things done... I can concentrate. 





But... why? And why now? I thought today would be a bad day... my therapist told me something a bit harsh and it's rocked my world... and yesterday my boyfriend who has PTSD after an accident and a hospital stay that left him braindamaged 15 years ago told me they did some new scans of his brains and they aren't satisfied and he needs to go in for a more 'expert' scan next week. 



I am not supposed to be okay today. What the heck??"
Pressure From Mom,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/pressure-from-mom.122680/,"My mom is a single parent and I've only been back with her for the past 6 yrs. I'm  20 now and due to rumors about me at my previous college I had to take a semester off and have really cut communication with everyone because of my worsening anxiety and trust. The past month has honestly been hell for me and I've relapsed with self harm multiple times. I just want to get everything off my chest since I can't open up to my family or friends.

I've found out my great aunts don't like me because I'm not fully black and don't even ""act"" black, my mom and siblings don't know about this, but they do know that I do have problems with anxiety and being categorized as anything. I cried for a couple of days after hearing that, and relapsed. I even got scolded for not overcoming my anxiety from my mom, who is very outgoing and friends with everyone. She also got mad at me for not knowing how to drive, fill out official papers, eating 3 meals a day, cook or clean and for not having a boyfriend or even looking for one.

Having someone that close to me  pick at my flaws really has made me feel even more naked and exposed to everything and everyone. It's bad enough to deal with these demons on my own,, but she's made me feel more lost than usual and I have only here to turn to for advice. Suicide is never an option for me since I have my baby niece and sister who look up to me, but i do want the pain and emptiness to disappear. I want to actually smile again and mean it."
In the tank (an interactive public diary),https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/in-the-tank-an-interactive-public-diary.121944/,"Day 1:



I meant to start this sooner but I just didnâ€™t make time for it. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just that I am lazy, or just didnâ€™t want to get this on paper (or whatever you call putting it on a website/forum). Iâ€™m not really sure how to start this so I guess I should explain what this is and why I am doing it.



This is my journey to find help, through any means possible. I know there is a diary section on this forum but I wanted people who felt the need to give feedback to be able to do so. I feel very lost in my life and I know I have several demons to slay and I am hoping maybe someone(s) can help me find my way again or just tell me if I am going the right way.  This whole thing seems very self-absorbed to me, but I am willing to try anything at this point.  



I made a list of 10 things I want to change to make my life better, and I hope if I write in this every day I will hold myself accountable.  So hereâ€™s the list:

1.  I would like to get down to around 222 lbs. Currently I am under 340â€_I think. Iâ€™m not at home but I will weigh myself and update it. For what itâ€™s worth I am 6â€™ 3â€ù and 32 years old.

2.  I have (what I consider) a fairly nice apartment.  I havenâ€™t really bought anything for it in the 13 months I have been here. I just signed a lease to stay through July 2017. So maybe try my hand at interior decorating?

3.  I would like to start playing video games again. I love video games, but with my depression I just donâ€™t seem to have the time to just â€œtrophy huntâ€ù like I used to. I would like to start again.

4.  I would like to work on my poker game.  I play poker a lot and sometimes I just make really bad decisions. This would be known as â€œTiltingâ€ù. I would like to work on maintaining good discipline.

5.  I would like to curb myâ€_other gambling habits.  I tend to go a bit overboard in playing other games that mathematically I know I canâ€™t win at.  I would like to keep myself in good money making situations. Although I wouldnâ€™t be opposed to the occasional table game when on vacation or something.

6.  Iâ€™d like to start saving money.  I have several things I do where I can make some â€œfound moneyâ€ù, I usually piss through it. I would like to start saving it for something, I donâ€™t know what.

7.  I would like to repair old relationships.  This probably isnâ€™t realistic with some that have ended and no other communication will be entertained. However there are some relationships I have â€œaccessâ€ù to that feel like they are fading fast.

8.  I would like to find the courage to meet people.  I have lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years now, it has 305,841 people.  I have yet to have a friendship out here. I donâ€™t go out (except to the casino, obviously), I donâ€™t like bars, or clubs. Pretty much any and all social situations scare the hell out of me. So I would like to maybe try to fix that.

9.  I would like to meet someone special.  Iâ€™m not anything amazing, most days I wouldnâ€™t even call myself a â€œgood personâ€ù.  Iâ€™m a lot to handle, and am not very fun with being constantly depressed.  I have limited interests and donâ€™t like large social gatherings; resulting in people having to choose me over their friends. It seems impossible to me but I am holding out a minimal amount of hope that someone could actually love me.

10.  Failing 8 and 9, I would like to learn to accept being unwanted and unloved. Again Iâ€™m realistic, I wouldnâ€™t date/befriend/touch me so I donâ€™t expect anyone else to either.  I would like to make peace with the fact that with everything against me there is a very good chance I will die alone and forgotten. 

So thatâ€™s the list.

My goal is to spend an hour writing every day for this.  Obviously I donâ€™t expect anyone to read every entry since Iâ€™m sure on days when there is a lot on my mind, these could get to become novels.

Well I have 15 minutes so I guess I can talk about the battle plan for the day.



I have $10 in free play at the casino so I plan to go down there and run through it and whatever I have the end cash out. Probably wonâ€™t be much but I like to play the $1.25 video poker.  Well I donâ€™t LIKE it, itâ€™s just a better game than slots as far as payout over time is concerned.  Itâ€™s a free shot at money so with no risk its positive expectation.  This free play is one of the things I would like to start saving. I canâ€™t really at the moment because I am broke until next my next paycheck (shocking, I know).

I work overnights so I will probably head home to sleep right after the free play, possibly pick up a breakfast sandwich or something on the way home. I sleep a lot, I should probably add stop sleeping 10-12 hours a day to the list. I need to be up at 9:15-9:30 to get to work on time, so a normal person might go to sleep around noon. Iâ€™ll be in bed by 10am, earlier if I go straight home. 



Okay, well time to go. Anything anyone would like to know, I will try to respond to in the next entry."
What it feels like lately,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/what-it-feels-like-lately.122720/,"So lately especially I've been taking extreme and quite sudden turns for the worst, lasting even just a day. And then the next day I'll be totally fine and positive. I've never been to see a professional about the way I behave... But I'm starting to believe there must be an explanation for the way I am feeling and why my emotions are becoming more and more intense and diverse.



So I was walking home the other morning with my boyfriend at 7 ish in the morning in Osaka, we had been out drinking together the night before... He started playing a game like being silly and hiding behind signs and stuff and then running past me, so I joined in and wedged myself in a little tight spot between buildings, and he ran past, and I know it was a joke but he ran away so fast and so far when I looked he was no where in sight. 

And that crushed me for some reason which is ridiculous. So I just stood there like a maniac hoping he would come back but he didn't, he'd probably already reached home at this point. And all of a sudden it felt like a huge hole punched in my gut and I I started sobbing and felt really really bad.

 So I started walking a bit whilst crying and found a railing I sat on with my back to the morning sun and just kept thinking 'the sun feels nice' but inside I felt the most wretched and awful and like I just couldn't try at life anymore and how tired I am. And I just kept sobbing and it wouldn't stop. And then he came back after about 15 minutes obviously worried and was so confused what was wrong... He talked me into coming home but I refused so many times because I just felt like saying goodbye to everything right then and there.

And then the next morning I woke up in a normal mood again. And now I woke up at 4 in the morning feeling numb. And my emotions are just like a yoyo and I can't control it.... And it's making me so confused and tired but all I know is the times when I feel down are getting significantly for frequent and intense and it's scaring me....

Disgusted with my weight,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/disgusted-with-my-weight.122271/,"I was out shopping today and happened to glance into a full length mirror. My legs looked massive, my tummy was sagging down, I wanted to run out of there and cry but I said no I am going to stay and do what I have to do reminding myself that my weight is not permanent. Disgusted with my body I was. I'm going to go and weigh myself now for the first time in a while   BRB...oh my goodness I was not expecting that. 22 stone 0 lbs. I'm trying so hard to lose weight,  I know it takes time and know what to do and avoid. I'm just ashamed that I let myself go like this. I feel disgusting. Does anyone have any nice tips for me?  I'm joining slimming world tomorrow, here's to a fresh start"
Just bleh.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/just-bleh.122018/,"I just need to vent about this... 



I have a scoliosis and only got the diagnosis a couple of years ago (because no doctor was allowed to examine me when I was a kid and a young teen...) and that means it is untreated... which is hard to live with. I have chronic pain, and if I am too active it hurts more and sometimes it locks nerves... sometimes in my leg and sometimes all the way to my toes... it has affected my bladder function, and because of my balance I haven't walked right for most of my year, my hip hurts too... 



I have to plan my activities every day... If someone is coming to visit and I have to give my tiny flat a good clean that takes a week... Monday I can vacuum, Tuesday I can clean the loo, Wednesday I can clean the toilet... etc. etc... I live with dishes cluttering my tiny kitchen that has no space already because washing the dishes hurts me especially... 



I am on pain relief... I take pills every 5 hours... It's supposed to be every 6 hours, but the last hour can get so painful I only let 5 pass... 



When my pains got really bad a couple of years ago I didn't want to get on pain relief... I had been addicted to paracetamol as a teenager, and since then I didn't even take aspirin for bad period cramps... and for months all I could do was lie in bed and sob. I lived off of toast I'd crawl to the kitchen to get, and sometimes I'd take a few more slices so I had for the next meal next to my bed as well. Nothing helped... I tried to stretch but it all only seemed to make me worse. 



I saw a doctor, got a special X-ray done... was told 'Its scoliosis, eat pills. go home'. And the doctor added that it wasn't supposed to hurt... but he didn't do more... just that. ""It shouldn't hurt. So yeah"". I asked him if I could get a scan... I know a few things about anatomy and I was thinking I had a slipping disc or one being squeezed by my twisting spine... he just laughed at me... I kept getting more and more pills... and no scans... 



A long while after I tried PhysioPilates because someone online had said that it helped with her scoliosis pain... that made me worse... I could barely walk for 2 days after a session... but the instructor was a physiotherapist and she assessed me one day when I showed up at the class in bad pains.... she told me I did indeed have a slipping disc in my spine. 



But yeah... my doctors doesn't seem to worry about that... they don't think that happens to a 26 year old. So why waste a scan on me? 



I am just so sick of having pains and essentially being handicapped. I wish I could exercise to help me lose weight, since all my eating disorders make it difficult to lose weight that way (and lets face it, being big doesn't help the pain... but the fact is I'd still hurt if I was skinny)... but I'm not allowed to anything more than walking... and even that hurts. 



Being young and living with this pain, and not being able to do normal things like taking the stairs... and dealing with people looking weird at me when I take elevators just because I don't look sick. And also... my best friend is so careful with me... she means well when she says things like ""Can you handle that?"" or do stuff for me... and if I wince in pain or stretch she gets worried... and my boyfriend too... when we talk on the webcam I have to get up and stretch a lot... and he always worries. 





Well... months ago I saw my doctor again... truth be told I was wondering if I could get on disability benefits... since... well how can I hold a full time job in this condition? Turns out the only way you can get that is having a mental illness... and on the paper my mental condition is not bad enough either... you have to fit a certain list of diagnoses for that... 



My doctor referred me to a center that was supposed to have some group sessions for people with chronic pains who needed to learn how to deal with it and settle with that life. I was actually looking forward to it... the only person I know with this was my mother, who took her frustrations out on my soul and body... and I never want to turn into her. 



I visited and had a meeting with a young woman there over a month ago... she had a whole questionnaire and went through it with me, they also talked about other conditions etc and I told her I had un-diagnosed PTSD which also kept me inside a lot... it was a horrible meeting and I left it shivering and almost cried on the street going home. She kept asking and tried to dig into what had caused my PTSD... and in the end she decided instead of the chronic pain curse she wanted me to join an anxiety group... with an instructor who was not an actual psychologist or therapist. 



I decided I didn't want to do that... I am currently in therapy with a therapist I trust and I am waiting on DBT to start... I worry about contradicting advice and to be honest... my issues aren't fit for someone who isn't a professional. 



A lady from that place finally called me today... first of all she left me a message and told me to come for an appointment on Wednesday, at the same time as I have my next appointment with my therapist. No way I am canceling that!! And the thing was supposed to start on Thursday... 

I called her back and told her (what I already told the other woman) that I am being treated as an outpatient under the healthcare already, and was waiting on DBT, and I wasn't sure it was a good time to be mixing all that into it as well... she reluctantly agreed with me... but kept telling me I was always welcome to get back in touch, and I should look at the psych clinic for their brochure and see if it was something for me after all. 



Maybe it's a possibility when my treatment at the psych clinic ends... so far it's set to a 20 week thing... though I already think I might need much more than that...  





But that was never why I was referred there!! I came for my back. Damn it. 



Anyway. I'll crawl to the kitchen and get myself some lunch and my pain relief... my daily routine... *sigh*"

I don't wanna kill myself anymore because what's the point? That won't make me happy. I don't wanna harm myself because that's just gonna hurt more, fuck that.

And by then I will have just killed myself. Oh, and on top of it I'm losing one of my best friends. Fuck my life. I'm done. I'm just going to lay in bed day and night until I waste away.

trigger- loss of dog,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/trigger-loss-of-dog.121794/,I just put my best friend to sleep not even 12 hours has passed. She was the sole reason I still existed. I am feeling so awful it was not me too. She was in too much pain that I could not justify keeping her in this world any longer. She was happy but so uncomfortable.  Been trying to go through with the day keeping myself busy but sleeping wasn't possible when thinking of her not breathing or being warm next to me anymore. That void. That snore. Just seeing myself shutting down and getting away from people already and take down that fence in my mind that has built in to keep things running smoothly and voices at bay. Now have no reason in the world to care. Have nothing to lose.
Confused and hurt,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/confused-and-hurt.122499/,i am not sure if this is the right place to go but I am struggle and confused and wanted to ask for so help. My boyfriend of 3.5 year tried to commit suicide this past month. He came home and everything was different. I have tried being there for him but I don't know how. He recently told me that he wasn't sure if he want to be with me. He said he is in a weird place and is confused. I don't know what to do. He says he loves me but it seems like all he can do is focus on the negitive things about our relationship. He shows lots of anger to me. It has been so hard not knowing what to do or say to him. Our relationship has had problem but most of the time we are happy until his depression came. I just feel so lost. I don't know if I should leave or stay. We are living together and have been for 2 years. I am so afraid of losing him.

I demanded explanations, I demanded reasons, she didn't give me any until I broke her down enough to make her say something...By the time I realized I was in the wrong and tried to make amends, it was too late...She was done with me. I...I just feel so awful...I loved her...I still love her. I wanna go back in time and scream at my past self for what I did. To stop it. Why? Why was I such an idiot? Why was I such a piece of shit?

Diary by CandleLight (replies welcome),https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/diary-by-candlelight-replies-welcome.122192/,"Today I saw my horse. She's an American Bashkir Curly Horse, and yes she actually has a curly coat! I bet you never heard of a poodle-horse before! Haha. But in the spring she loses most of her curls.



Carly's basically a Mustang, the breed of horse that still runs in a few wild herds in the United States. Carly is short and stocky, with a neat color of red with white flecks (this is called a roan coat- they also come in blue [really gray]). Carly also has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. 



I gave Carly her grain and some grass pellets, and brushed her a lot with the shedding comb. When I am with my horse, my head gets so quiet. My PTSD symptoms literally disappear, for the time I am with her. I don't even mind spending over an hour combing every burr out of her mane and tail. 



Carly is the biggest slow-poke of a horse you ever saw. When I ride her, she stops a lot. Or refuses to go in a straight line. Or both. She's not used to being ridden much, and even before I got her she didn't get saddled up very often for many years. And she likes it that way. Carly will go on a trail ride if I make her, but really prefers being petted while eating a bucket of grain. What a life!



I worry a whole lot about possible upcoming emergency vet bills, as I am homeless and really, really struggling financially. But Carly helps to keep me going, so I would never give her up. We mean a lot to each other."

He's also mentioned his foot fetish and how he wants pictures of my feet for the express reason of masturbation. There's been times I wake up and pretend to still be asleep because I can feel him move my blanket trying to take pictures of them.

i think it is so strange how we are all able to tell others just how much they are worth to the world, but yet it is so difficult for us to feel the same way about ourselves. if only we knew how to internalize our positive beliefs and apply them to our own lives, maybe we could help our own selves. depression truly is an ugly ugly thing that prevents us from seeing how worthy we are of happiness"

I know i have looked after this girl quiet a few times without her mum or dad around. But now it feel so different and more responsibility as before they were mostly out for fun not because both parents were working.



I will be picking her up from school everyday so I'll be the ione who communicates with her teachers. Some night it will be dinner and bed and I'll be sleeping at their house as it will be to late for me to go home as they only own one car and my friend won't be home till well after midnight and her partner gets home around 10.30/11 during the week night but later Friday's as he is a chef. 



I don't know what my friends roster will be yet she will either finish around 3pm or midnight but there is also travel time to get home and she could be working 3he drive from home(i hope that will be a rare exception) and it won't be more than 2hrs for her to get home even that's a big drive.



I am panicked if somthing happens to her daughter as I don't have my licence so i dont drive or even have a car so in an emergency i can't really get anywhere fast. Her partner is at least a 20min train ride away plus walking to and from his work or to the house.  I'm panicked i wont be good enough to look after her I'm panicked somthing will go wrong that she will get hurt and it will be my falut.....or she won't listen to me about somthing. I'm scared to be firm with her and don't know how to do it properly(with her) she is not a difficult child at all she is quiet good but I'm just scared. What if she starts to miss her mum and I can't calm her down......she misses her dad when he's at work she always has but she has not been away from her mum this long before. This week will be the first week so I don't expect her to miss her to much just yet. I just panic she will get upset or hurt and I won't be able to comfort her or calm her.



I can't even get out all that's going through my head its just going so fast right now.

This is my only friends daughter and i have spent quiet a lot of time with them both and know quiet well how my friend and her partner parent but I am different I will try and do my best to stick to their ways but i know things will be different.

When talking fails,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/when-talking-fails.122459/,"I finally talked to my spouse yesterday. Talking to him even about small things is extremely difficult because he has held a pattern, many in fact that has proven to me that talking is ineffective but its what I'm supposed to do right? He doesn't like touch, giving it or receiving it from me. Yes me specifically. He's very affectionate with the children, plays with them constantly, hugs them ect, but doesn't do that with me at all. Two days ago I guess I crossed a line trying to hug him, wanting to be touched, I like listening to his heart beat and I feel safer in his arms, he pushed me away and stated as he likes to that he's not going anywhere. Well I fucking know that. Very short conversation there that ended in me stating that he doesn't like to be touched and he said ""Sorry"". So I very carefully laid out my words yesterday that it bothers me. It bothers me also that any choice or opinion I have that doesn't match his will continue in the same question over and over until I agree. These are life decisions not daily shit. I told him that not wanting to touch me or wanting me to touch him is painful. There is no rejection quite that that. I said I've already given up so much. None of what I said was hateful, I didn't raise my voice, shit I didn't even cry which is a first. And what was I met by? Silence all night. This is why it doesn't pay to talk. On the other hand my stomach didn't kill me last night so I guess it helped a little bit."

Like wtf I don't know what to think,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/like-wtf-i-dont-know-what-to-think.122560/,"So I told my mom that I had been feeling anxious this past year and had talked to a doctor.  Then I told her that I went to a school counsellor and that memories started coming back.  I told her that I think a man touched me when I was like maybe 3-4.



So what does she tell me, well all students get anxious about stuff.  It's part of university and choosing to be away from home.  She also told me that counsellors can sort of put false memories into people's brains.  Like that people have been wrongly accused of child abuse.  She also told me that she would have never left me alone so this can't have happened.



So what does she tell me to do, well talk to people, hang out with friends.



Of course I didn't tell her that well she verbally abused me for years and that some of the memories were of her.  She also doesn't know that I SH or have suicidal thoughts.  



The irony of  all this is that we lost a family friend to suicide a few years ago, so you'd think she'd be more open to this.  



I'm like okay I'll try to hang out will more people and remember that school is stressful and that all students get anxious. 



She does so not get it and I don't really know how to make her understand."

I don't feel sorry for myself either, I know nothing that happened to me is my fault, but I've accepted it happened. I don't really grieve anymore, I sometimes get angry, I sometimes get sad, but for the most part I'm emotionally dead. I still can't talk to people, I'm basically incapable of maintaining a conversation. I basically sit in the background watching everyone else progress, I still don't take chances, still get picked on from time to time. Although it's much worse than before I just don't care at all anymore. You always here people say I don't care what people say when really they do and hide it but I really don't and honestly I know it's a bad thing. I have no motivation, I see no future for myself, but yes I know I must trudge on because things will get better, at least that's what they say. I honestly know I will never physically harm myself I just don't see a point of hurting yourself while hurting, if I even hurt anymore. No one knows about the real me, no one really asks either. No one shows interest in me but I've gotten used to it, nowadays I wake up go to school then go sit at the marina and stare at the ocean there's nothing poetic about it i just get bored.

The only time I feel better is when I reach a state of numbness, where I feel nothing at all. I feel no fear, no sadness, no love, no joy. These are the times when I feel I am ready to do it. I feel i could <mod edit - methods> and I am no longer afraid. In reality, I dont want to die. I just dont want to feel this way anymore."

Need advice please,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/need-advice-please.122751/,"So I need advice on how to be assertive with my needs....



I'll try and explain the best I can, my friend has a job now and don't get me wrong I am so glad that she does.....but she does a mix of night shifts and morning shifts. Her partner works quiet late as well but always has. So I babysit when they are both at work.



Before I started I said I could do a max of 3 night's a week, she said that was fine and wouldn't expect me to do it that often. But she didn't listen to my requests.



I am scared enough of this friendship ending as it is my only friendship I have in my life.

I want to help my friend out because I am that kind of person, I will go to great lengths to help my friend(s if i had more)



I don't know how to say what I need amongst all this as I know they need the money desperately and as I said I am glad to help.........BUT i think every on has their limits I'm sure and I can't help but feel I'm being taken advantage of a bit, not totally but enough. They are paying me minimal amounts and I'm not doing it for the money it's just a bonus for me.



But my friend said she is going to take every shift possible and thay could mean her being away for a week or two at a time. I have my fingers crossed that doesn't happen. 



I find it hard enough to say what I need and want as it is. And it took me about two week to build up the courage and say I could only do a max of 3 night's a week.



So how do you go about being more assertive so that what you say is actually heard and taken seriously??  

I am always scared of saying what I need or thing for fears that nobody will like me.



Don't get me wrong the child is amazing and I enjoy her company and playing with her.



I use to think this friendship was a two way street but even before she started work things were starting to feel like I one way street.



I know it all my fault for letting myself get walked all over and not being able to say no, but i just don't know how to state my needs again it was hard enough the first time"

If I could take a pill to rid myself of all emotions, I would likely do it. I don't care if living like a robot would be worse. I don't care that emotions are what makes us human. All that ever does is hurt me deeply. I am tired of being lied to, manipulated, called down, and treated like crap ever since I was a little kid. I'm just sick of it all. I want to numb myself and shut down and hide forever."
So frustrated,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/so-frustrated.122252/,"So I reported my counsellor to his supervisor because he made me feel like I was deserving and responsible for the verbal child abuse that I told him about.

Like wtf, he put what I like to call a deadly idea into my head.  I want the supervisor to talk to and educate all the counsellors, but no she will talk to him.  And maybe put up a sign telling students how to complain."
Falling apart,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/falling-apart.122063/,"Social anxiety and depression are destroying me.

I also don't trust the so-called professionals and am also skeptical of how effective the medicine really is, which was made worse after a friend killed himself around 1 month ago, after being depressed and in treatment for over 10 years. My family has also expressed an intolerance and disrespect for people with social anxiety before (not just with that, either, they're really close-minded in general) so I can't even get myself to tell them I have it, or that I've dropped out of college because of it. I've been just pretending to go, but I actually gave up on it around 8 months ago, I just can't take it. This is my second attempt at college, in the first one I dropped out after only 2 months. I only have friends online, have very few very limited interests or things I somewhat enjoy, and I thought I was doing a good job on at least keeping the suicidal feelings away but now they're back. Had them for several years, last year was the peak, and in january and february I was mostly not thinking about it anymore even though I was still feeling terrible. Now I feel so worthless, hopeless, stuck and alone that they're suddenly coming back full force and I just wish I would have ended everything last year as planned. I don't see a way out of this hell. I've been thinking so much about telling my family I need help, but even assuming that they'd be willing to help, there's nothing they can even do to help anyway, so what's the point."

I've since had another flare up of tonsillitis which did resolve itself, but I am left now feeling achey and tired all the time. It physically hurts to lift my arms to do anything like write or type and I'm really struggling with the physical stuff at work because I have no strength and feel so tired. Right now my mouth is full of sores which are very painful. I have one behind my back molars and it is mimicking infected wisdom tooth pain (definitely not a tooth cutting through) and the entire right side of my face hurts and aches, it's in my ear and my other teeth hurt.

"Toxic social media, or: yoga on horseback",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/toxic-social-media-or-yoga-on-horseback.122316/,"Some of you know I am having a really hard time feeling like Facebook friends don't care about me at all, and I am mourning the loss of some formerly important friendships I once had.  I spent a little time here in San Francisco yesterday with two friends back to visit California, after they moved to North Carolina about 3 years ago.



I still have a lot to say about this upsetting experience, which I will write about later in my Diary by CandLight.  But I need to start this thread to laugh a little.  Because I really need to laugh about this.



When my friends/ former friends picked me up in the car, within a few moments we were driving down a steep San Francisco hill and my friend, naturally, took out her phone to get a pic of the road.  We didn't spend a lot of time together, which was both a relief and very hard and sad.  But in that time, she managed to get pics of almost everywhere we went, from the mechanical museum (mini arcade) to a small beach cove area.  We didn't spend a lot of time talking.  It was very awkward.  But she sure took pictures!  Various selfies and snapshots of ""cool stuff"".



It's like, why are photos so important?  What about the actual experiences you have in life?  There is a joke online when someone describes something incredible, and people respond with ""pic or it didn't happen!""  I think some people take that to heart.  It's like they don't feel they exist fully if they aren't documenting every moment.



Which leads me to my other former/ lost friend, a person I first brought out to the barn to help me with my horse.  We used to hang out together, I've gone to her place a few times and we usually got Starbucks before the barn.  It was nice.  Then we drifted apart pretty fast, and while I understand what I think the reason was, it still hurt a lot.  It still hurts even now.



So this person got her own horse, and she did a very good job training it.  It was truly impressive, and it makes sense she wanted to show off a little online.  This person has not just Facebook going, but Instagram, Snapchat and I imagine a few other sites she regularly uses.  She gets a lot of likes for her many pictures, always beautiful and perfectly filtered.  But now I can kind of laugh about how hard she must be trying.  I'm not laughing *at* her, just at the absurdity of taking so many pics of things that you are more concerned with setting up a great shot than actually just LIVING LIFE.



I think a lot of people kind of chuckle when they see concert footage and there are a million people watching the concert they were lucky to get seats at, entirely through the screens of their cell phones.  A tiny screen is absolutely not the same as sitting back and enjoying a great concert.  Who cares if you want everyone to see the fun time you had?  Why don't you ACTUALLY try to have a good time and make memories.  Not pictures to prove that you were there.



Anyway, my former/ lost friend began practicing yoga regularly, and she got quite good at it.  And, as I said, she's great with horses.  So now she posts a ton of photos of her doing yoga on her horse.  Really cool stuff like scorpions, various poses, the horse calm underneath her and the light bouncing off the field below so beautifully.  The photos are nice, yes.



But you have to wonder:  how much are you documenting your experiences, instead of living them, if you make a point to show everyone that you can do yoga on a horse?"
This really bothers me.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/this-really-bothers-me.121402/,"I don't know if this will trigger anyone, so I apologize in advance if it does. When I got to my uncle's this morning, he informed me that a friend of my cousin killed himself recently. Everyone was really shocked, but those who knew him had expected it somewhat, as he had tried a few times before. I felt sad for my cousin, because he had lost another friend through suicide several years ago. My uncle tried looking up the story online and couldn't find anything. That was strange, since he had supposedly done it in a public place. Well, my aunt sent a text saying the guy had faked it all.



I just...I can't really wrap my head around this. Why would you fake your own death just to get attention? I couldn't imagine hurting anyone like that. I felt for him a bit, since clearly he needs help, but it also made me angry that he would do that. It made me think about my own suicidal feelings even more. One reason I haven't done it yet is because it would hurt those who care about me. But how will they know when he is really in trouble if he cries wolf like that? I just don't know what to think about all of this."
My diary (I <3 replies),https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/my-diary-i-3-replies.122354/,"[So I decided to make this diary because I wasn't sure where to talk about all the little things I feel and minor things that happen without spamming threads.  I don't know how often I'll write here, but as the title says, when I do, I'd enjoy it if people would reply (if they'd like.)  If something big comes up or I start feeling severely suicidal, I probably make another thread.  However, my feelings have been rather low-key of late.]



I'm feeling down and kinda want to hurt myself, but it's not anything serious.  I mean, I made myself bleed a little not too long ago by messing with the scabs covering the places where I'd minorly injured myself a few days ago and thought about making some new ones, but a crisis this isn't.  Honestly this might be no more than boredom, loneliness and overthinking.



I just keep thinking too much.  Tonight I came to the conclusion that I should not be alive, that I was not meant to be on this earth.  I'm not sure what made me think that, but it has stuck with me.  I texted my friend (one of the two I've been torturing with talk of suicidal thoughts recently) about it, and he reassured me that I should be alive.  I told him I had trouble believing him.  Now I feel a little guilty about the disbelief somehow.  



I'll probably lie here and watch Netflix instead of sleeping.  Like that's gonna make me feel better."
miserable and alone,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/miserable-and-alone.121981/,"I wish I'd never existed. In retrospect my life has been a constant battle with anxiety, depression and panic attacks. I've spent most of the time trying to fix myself and others. Just doesn't make sense any more. I'm tired of the constant battle and see no light at the end of the tunnel. I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. I'm alone anyway and have no family except my dog, who's been more of a friend than anyone to me. The last person who cared about me passed away last year and it's been a downward spiral since. 

 Even writing this looks like the epitome of self pity, so be it......I don't know how else to feel. If only there were a timeline on this pain, if only I could see an end to it, but I don't. Each day seems worse than before with the occasional short(hours) reprieve. I'm tired of trying to act like everything is okay and wearing a mask for others to see. I don't want to burden others with my dark feelings, most wouldn't understand anyway. I'm just tired and weary."

Used....,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/used.122755/,"I've known this girl for a while now and I thought we were becoming really good friends. She's a lesbian so didn't think much about it, just that I liked hanging out because it got me out of this lonely rut I'm in. She's always hanging out with this other girl and she stays over at her place a lot, though she said they're just friends. I got into doing some things for her, like driving her to places she needed to go, and going to the grocery store. This was all happening while her other friend was studying for exams. One night we hung out at her place and one thing led to another, and we became intimate. This happened the next day as well, but after that things changed. Her other friend had finished exams, and she stopped responding to my texts. I send some texts frequently over the last couple of weeks, and tried calling her a few times. I knew she often ran out of minutes so I didn't think much of it. This is what we've always done before, either texted or called each other. I went out last night to a pub for a drink, because my birthday is on Monday and I wanted a night out. I met her and her friend in there, they were eating. I sat at the bar and didn't say anything else to her, and before I knew it they had left. I then got a text shortly afterwards that my constant texting and trying to call her was making her uncomfortable and she wanted me to leave her alone. It wasn't any more than I normally would have done when she was talking to me. 



Now I just feel used. She could have just talked to me rather than ignore me for the last few weeks. I let her know that all she does is use me while her other friend is away, and that I hope she's happy with herself. I've since deleted her number, but today I feel so down I'm not sure what to think of it. I'll be 32 tomorrow. Another year of loneliness, hopelessness and frustration."

Dont know why I have to be the problem,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/dont-know-why-i-have-to-be-the-problem.121973/,"I dont know why my roommate and neighbor have been angry and snapping at me lately. I had a fight with my roomate because she snapped at me for asking her a question as to wether or not she wanted to keep a bottle that was full of liquid or if I could return it. Telling me when does she ever not drink her drinks? I said I dont know, when your sick or not feeling well like you have lately? Then complaining I dont talk loud enough. I am getting so sick of being treated this way and so I foght back this time and told her maybe she needed her ears checked. (Yea I did escalate it but Im so sick of just being told Im annoying or a burden and want to just stick up for myself for once) I ask her today why she is mad at me and she just tells me she needs space. And really I think she is just seriously sleep deprived. She keeps being out all day avoiding being home. And complains all the time about Henry being in the way, or me annoying her, or so and so pissing her off. 



My neighbor asked if I wanted to return cans with her and go can hunting. But I only read the return part. So I came out from that fight with my roomie to meet up with her and needed to get my service dog in training out (he had been couped up for 2 days) so I told her I would bring him. But I didnt realize she wanted to go hunting also and didnt think I had the energy to do so. She noticed I was off and asked what was wrong so I just told her I thought (and I did) she meant just returning them, not looking for more. (And avoided talking about the fight because I didnt think she needed to know nor did I care to talk about it) She told me ok, I could go and get Henry out and she would go herself with the cans. Well I messaged her later in the evening to ask how the canning went. She told me she didnt want to talk. Texted her today and asked how she was. No response. Asked her if she was mad at me or something and just not returning messages or what. Apparently she is. But I still dont know what I did wrong. She told me I was condesensing and didnt even bother to knowor ask her how she was going to do things on her own.. Well.. She told me she would be fine on her own and I told her where to go so I assumed she would be fine.  I dont know how I was condesending. And she told me she felt like I wasnt treating her like a friend like she was inconviniencing me. (Which to be honest she kind of was because I had planned to do something else and had gone back home to go do canning with her) Yet she well understands I have my own disabilities (physical) and limits. And I am sure I told her I wasnt sure I could physically walk around all day. (She is in a wheelchair) So I apologyzed but still dont understand what I did wrong. And it is eating at me. 



Why am I always the one at fault? Why am I the one ""bothering"" everyone else? Why is it never anyone elses fault? Am I really that annoying and such a burden? Just because I need to take care of my own needs too? Just because I am capable of sticking up for what I want now? And getting sick of being put down? Or am I in the wrong? And if I am, what exactly did I do wrong?"

For the life of me, I don't know why people think it is okay to bully me. I ""do"" speak up! I ""do"" say stop. So why does this behavior continue to happen towards me? 



I work in academia. For the past 4 years, which equates to all of my years at this academic position, I have been bullied by the known department bullies. One was assigned to be my mentor, the other actively recruited me for this position.  I finally gained the strength and self-confidence to interview for academic jobs elsewhere. On Friday, I was given a tentative offer which would become final once the reference and background checks were completed. I told my references to expect a call. One of my references said that she would hate to lose me but understands why I need to leave. Hello, I'm suicidal, depressed, and physically ill due to workplace bullying. Well this person who said that she would be my reference and wrote an excellent reference, tells me that when she spoke with the other university, she gave me a bad reference. In fact, she tells me that she went into the department's dirty laundry. What a POS!!!! The dysfunction of my current department has nothing to do with my potentially new job. If I'm not telling them, why on earth would she? Bitch.



Needless to say, I have been devastated since I spoke with my POS reference this morning. Why on earth would she feel it is okay to do this? The reality is that I will be leaving the department after this school year, even if I do not have a job, and even if I have to leave in a body bag.



I provided this POS reference with the reasons why I'm choosing this new opportunity. These were all true and all positive. She had no reason to add her unwarranted 2 cents.



I hate her. What a POS. People in the department do not like her and I have been sticking up for her. NO MORE!"
Intense Loneliness,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/intense-loneliness.122037/,"Ever since birth, I remember being friendless, I had people I could speak to, that I classified as ""friends"", but never anyone my age that I could actually trust.



I'll admit, I don't help myself much, I barely ever go out, I avoid speaking to alot of people, and when I do, I seem to naturally put them in the most awkward positions ever.



That's why I developed voices, why I began to speak to inanimate objects. I just feel, so completely devoid of companionship, and whenever I try to gain it, I always end up with just another ""friend"".



I'll admit it, I'm a manipulative bastard. I test people that I know, and after testing every single one of the people that I had any social connection to... every single one of them did the exact same thing.



I told them fabricated stories, then told them that I can't have anyone else knowing, they were all coherent, just in case two people came in contact.



So I made 40 fake facebook accounts, and I spoke to every single one trying to get this ""information"" out of them.



Every single one blabbed, some to more than one person. They didn't question it. They just told me what I had said, threw in some extra stuff, and then I had a very in-depth conversation with each one about how ""****ing weird"" Matthew is.

Alone in this prison there is a door that never opens.



Alone in this prison I peer, I hear, I imagine things beyonds these walls.



My life has been grasping for courage for hope for fortune.  I would be very grateful for the dimmest shade of light...



I have to deduce that I'm just not a good person.  I'm not enough.  I'm not special in any way, to any one, there's little chance I ever will be.



I'm self deprecating.  I've withered into nothing.  I haven't tried in years.  It's a defense against what has come before.  What repeats.  New faces, new places, new romance.. always ends the same.  Why would it be any different if I tried again?  How DO you try again after hiding for so many years alone.. withering.. afraid.. bitter.. empty inside.. steeling that emptiness with a tight shell of self hatred.. how do I decide to live again?  I've been dead for so long.. but another venture in betrayal would rot the corpse i've become.  I couldn't endure it.. and I can't endure this.. solitude.. loneliness.. self exile any better.



What is this place for?  To vent?  To articulate hopelessness and superfluity?  To attempt to mold form to the erratic and crushing and mad-flailing pings and chokes and hiccups of emotional failings?



Since I have no one.  Speak to no one.  Am loved by no one.  Am valued by no one.  Maybe I should attempt the pointless experiment of at least speaking out loud.

Nicotine and Caffeine,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/nicotine-and-caffeine.122382/,"Today is April 18, 2016. Today marks one year I proved I was strong enough to leave an abusive relationship. This day may not be special to anyone else, but today I am so proud of myself. After three years of being mentally and physically beat down, I have officially been free of it all for an entire year today. I am a survivor. I may not have anyone in my life right now that knows everything that happened, but dear god, I have me. I know what I did. I know what I have overcome. 



Yesterday I think I lost my best friend. I could tell her anything and everything going on and so much of me wants to scream to her that I am still here today after all of this and revel in my accomplishment. But I met her on here, so I should be okay with the suicide threats and pictures of self injury I received, but it just made me so sad. I haven't been in the right frame of mind to be able to help her. So I decided that I would rather her be mad at me than for her to not be here at all. I messaged her mother on Facebook to help her because I knew I couldn't. When I saw her picture it triggered me so much all I wanted to do was do the same to my body. To feel that feeling. So I knew I wouldn't be able to stop her. Instead of understanding that I was trying to be helpful she ended up blocking me. This is the twenty-first century and she can do as she pleases, but have it known I did the same to her. After I found out she blocked me I did the same for a few hours. On everything she could possibly use to contact me. If I was going to be exiled for helping, I wasn't about to be a victim. 



Today, I have re-evaluated my maturity and unblocked everything because I know I am a survivor. I don't need to add drama to my life anymore. I've had quite enough drama in my life. 



Today, my name is Kaitlin and I am surivivor. 



I don't know what tomorrow holds for me, but looking at how far I have come in just a year I know I can do this. I'm just over a week free of self harm myself and I will celebrate every single second of that. 



I have depression and anxiety and it sucks, but I refuse to let it be the end of the world. 



Today, as I sit outside in the sunlight smoking my cigarette and drinking my coffee I began thinking just how amazing all human beings are. 



I am a human being too.



I am amazing.



You are amazing.



We are all amazing.



It's about time everyone realized just how incredible we all really are.

Sick apparently?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/sick-apparently.121948/,"I am exhausted. I know I would be after the weekend... 



For once I hadn't set my alarm, and I fell asleep early last night, I only woke up after 1pm... and I was still tired... I got up though and got slightly productive... I cleaned my freezer, took a good shower, finally got the dishes that has piled up for days and days (they have been rinsed though)... and I somehow thought I'd feel good about that... 



Of course, washing the knives I was tempted to harm myself... and I had to use a lot of mental strength to just wash them, wipe them and put them in the drawer. 



I have 'realized' I am still sick. I have been thinking I was tired, depressed and anxious and that was what kept me so exhausted. The doctor who saw me at the psych ER a couple of weeks ago said I probably had the flu after checking my vitals and for a few days I did try to take care of that. 



But I'm starting to think I still have it. 



But... spending most days indoors and a lot of the time in bed I guess I don't notice... It worries me though, if I can't realize I've got flu. 

It does make sense  now though... nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, getting warm, runny nose, headache and what I thought was food poisoning... that's what the flu always does to me. Today I have the final proof; further loss of hearing. 



I am already nearly deaf on one ear, and have a bad hearing on the other... this is due to too many ear infections and various procedures to cure them too... the scarring on my eardrums have messed up the pressure inside my ears... and when I'm sick that balance gets even worse... 



So. I'm sick. 

It worries me. What else have I been ignoring?? How low can you get emotionally? 



And I really don't need more excuses to stay in my flat and not go outside... I am trying to work against my anxiety here... trying to come up with reasons to get out. Of course fresh air is good. That's a positive one.

I always said her I dont want her to touch me.

I've been having a strange issue with my new Laptop, where every few days, my screen reader slows down to a crawl and is barely able to function. The sound it makes when this happens is like none I've ever heard, sort of like it's straight out of a Star Wars movie. My guess is that something is bogging down the memory, and so maybe it needs more Ram; but just for the hell of it, I called the manufacturer and tried to explain what happens. I started the call off by explaining that I'd probably only be able to provide limited information because I'm totally blind, but was just looking for some input on what the cause might be. When I explained the problem, the first question was, ""Can you tell me what's on the screen when this happens?"" Um... nope, I can't. ""OK then, please give us a call back when this happens again so you can verify for us what you see on the screen."" Um... again, impossible. I'll see the same thing then that I do now, which is nothing. ""Well (at this point, he's getting desperate), when it happens again, please have someone who can see describe the screen for us."" Right... the last time it happened was midnight a few days ago. I'm sure the couple across the street wouldn't mind THAT wake-up call! Needless to say, I bought an 8GB stick of Ram and am hoping that fixes the problem. If it doesn't, I'm off to the Geek Squad at BestBuy.



Next issue, fraudulent charges on my credit card, that I wasn't aware of immediately because my statement comes in a format I can't read. I called, again explained that I'm totally blind, and that I need some assistance in dealing with this because I'm not able to handle it the usual way. I also explained that their website is no longer accessible with a screen reader, so I have no way of accessing crucial account information. First thing he asks me to do is read something to him from my account page on their site. Strike One. Next, he'll send me a statement in the mail, and I can circle the charges I wish to dispute and mail it back. Strike Two (no reliable sighted help in the area at the moment). At this point, we're both getting frustrated, and he agrees to circle the charges for me and handle it personally. THANK YOU!!!

This isn't a damned joke!,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/this-isnt-a-damned-joke.122260/,"I fail to understand why my landlord thinks it's funny when he's had multiple complaints about bats getting into this apartment. He said he doesn't know how to get rid of them, and asked if we could do it. Um, what? That's your job, isn't it? It was bad enough when one was flying through the kitchen one night. It was even worse when one came through the light fixture above the shower. But what tops it off is when I am sitting on my bed, minding my own business, when suddenly something hits me in the side. I get up because I instantly know what it is. I lock myself in the bathroom, thinking I will be safe there. But no, of course not! The damned thing CRAWLS UNDER THE DOOR! I start throwing things at it, thinking it will go out the other way. No, it comes flying at me, and I have to run out of there. Granted, it is small and probably harmless, but freaked me out beyond belief. Dare I say it was kind of cute? But that's not the point. The point is, I am afraid that one will bite me when I am sleeping or something. 



I am wondering, what happens if the landlord refuses to do anything? Who do I contact next? I am beyond freaked, I have that creepy crawly feeling. I even cried and screamed a bit, yes I am a girl  Of course, they always disappear when my grandpa tries to get them. No, I'm not crazy. Another thing I am wondering, should I go to the doctor if the thing just landed on me? Or am I likely in the clear? I don't think I can get any disease just from close contact, but I don't know for sure. Any input would be much appreciated."
Had a shitty night,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/had-a-shitty-night.122347/,"Just want to get this off my chest because I feel totally alone.



My blood-sugar was running high all night (I have type 1 diabetes), and I thought I had it covered when I gave myself more insulin before I went to bed. I'm also sick, but it's nothing more than fatigue, sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion. Nothing more, pssh... Anyway, I didn't want to wait 2 hours for the insulin to completely take effect because fuck that, so I went to sleep right away. However, I woke up a few hours later, around 6 AM, and I was just contemplative and feeling especially suicidal. It took me a while, but I realized that I probably woke up because my blood-sugar was still high--it fucking was. That in particular made me feel even more helpless. I took MORE insulin, lied down and brooded for about an hour, and I checked my blood-sugar again, and it was fine. Yay. Afterwards, I tried going back to sleep, but by then, my suicidal thoughts and hopeless pondering had already consumed me. I can only idle away so much time before I lose myself to suicidal ideation. Nothing happened. I wasn't feeling impulsive--just ill-fated. I contacted my counselor, whom I was supposed to have an appointment with today, and explained to her why can't make the appointment, and she was understanding. I wasn't going anywhere if my body and mind was simultaneously making me feel dreadful.



It's odd to say, but those two hours that I spent contemplating suicide felt ephemeral. In my case, I feel like depression doesn't necessarily perpetuate my life--it hastens it."
Elevators and rude people,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/elevators-and-rude-people.122427/,"I just need to let some steam out (well more than I already did while writing complaints to the relevant people)... 



I am unfortunate enough to have an 'invisible' handicap... (untreated scoliosis)... which among many other things means that stairs are my enemy... it causes me a lot of pain and I'm so, so scared of falling because of my screwed balance. And the pain isn't just over once I leave the stairs... it lasts the entire day, adding to my chronic pain. 



Sunday I was going home from a lovely weekend with my friend and some of her friends, by train... there 2 elevators were out of service, meaning I was forced to use the stairs... which I did. 



Today I took a shortcut home from the store that lead me through the train station... I figured by now they must have fixed the elevator... I mean, there's people in wheelchairs and people with prams who need to use them. Well... I was being stupid. 



So yeah... I staggered down the stairs, carrying heavy groceries... I was about to cry from pain at that point, but I kept a brave face. 



I went to the kiosk, I know they aren't officially connected to the station (they just have their shop in the station building and sell tickets...) and I told the girl there about the elevator. She didn't seem impressed, even if I mentioned that it was very 'inconvenient' for handicapped people... she then spotted a man in an orange suit and told me to run after me. 



I'm sorry? RUN? I could barely walk. I had hoped at least she could take a message or something... but nope... 



I went home, fuming and hurting... opened my laptop and wrote two complaints... one to the train company and another to the kiosk. 



I mean, WTF, for at least 4 days the elevator has been out of service. There was no notes anywhere saying it was out of order, so for all I know no one is fixing it. 



I am lucky, despite the pain, that I could make it down the stairs. But a person in a wheelchair will be caught there. 



I am so sick of this. 



And also... another thing I am sick of is the looks people give me when I go for an elevator at all... I weigh a bit too much, but the truth is even if I was skinny I'd still have pains (yes, maybe a little less, but still)... and it's very hard to exercise with this condition, the only exercise I'm allowed is walking... and even that hurts."

How often do you feel suicidal?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/how-often-do-you-feel-suicidal.122060/,"How often do you feel suicidal?  And I don't necessarily mean the extreme where you actually have a method ready.

If you reply to this post, you could also include the frequency of times that you actually think about suicide, whether extreme or moderate or mild.  Because, after all, I want to cover the whole range, that is, from extreme to ""moderate"" wishes.  In my case, even though I am past middle age already, I generally only seldom think of actual methods, but at least once a week fantasize how wonderful it would be if my doctor told me I have a terminal illness from which I would die within a month.   In other words, in my case, it's mild to moderate 99% of the time, which means, I guess, that I'm within the safety zone.

So while I don't actively seek out any methods, I at least fantasize about the joy I would feel if I ever get a terminal-type diagnosis from my doctor.

I know i have adhd and depression and residual social phobia but thats all that i am diagnosed with.

I had a violent father and also was bullied by boys in high school. Specially because I wasnt attractive. (high school bullies)

I am also a lesbian but it is because i am sexually attracted to women not because of my problems with males.



Anyway I have strong disgust for males now and I try my best to act like I dont. I have it when they stare at me in places. Or when they try to hit on me even though I show that I am not interested or when they act bitter and hostile when I dont say ok to them.



I hate their sexism homophobia ableism ageism racism. I hate their strong efforts to make people who arent like them second class person.



I dont even want to leave the home some days because i dont want to see some males' disgusting faces and stares.

This because (a) it's just more than any sane person can handle (b) I'm constantly feeling tired (c) Sometimes I will feel overwhelmed and end up not doing anything at all (d) Sometimes I just don't get the stuff because the lecture is moving to fast (but guess what the other four lectures are so slow they don't even really require my attention at all).

I know I should be taking off a day or at least half a day every week to rest and regain some energy, I should be exercising to gain some abs and also release some endorphins, I should also be solving more exercises to actually hand in some every now and then (I'm so glad this is not required at my school!), I should be learning more for my exams, I should be organizing my lecture notes, I should maintain a clean room and more funny stuff in the next point. It's just too much and I don't feel like doing anything at all. I'm lucky because I have my finances covered I guess since I still live with my Mom and the government pays me some (small) scholarship so I don't have to bother that much about that but it's still just too many things. In all this I don't have any time for myself at all and the crazy thing is that if for once I have time for myself I don't know what do anymore, I feel like I got completely lost in all this!



So I guess this is already point two. I feel damn lonely. Now social anxiety always held me back getting to know many people even before Uni. But it's a fact that in soon a year I only got to know around 5-10 people at Uni and I don't really consider any of them to be a really close friend. I guess I'm ok with not knowing too many people at Uni though, because there wouldn't be enough time to talk with people anyway (also most don't even live in my city and just commute here during the semester). It's more a problem that I don't really see myself getting to know any people outside Uni either. Really when I don't have to go to Uni I don't go anywhere at all. I know I could go to the library, and I did this a couple times, but it's not like people go there to talk with other people and get to know them. Most are either only there to actually study or they are with friends they already know. People on some forums suggested me I should be looking into clubs and all, but first of all there aren't even that many at my Uni and second as said I don't even really know what I want to do anymore. I guess I'm ok with only having 2 or 3 friends from High School but as stupid it would be with my current life circumstances I still wished I had a boyfriend...  So far every love I had was a one sided crush. That I'm gay doesn't make it any more likely for me to actually find someone. I tried online dating in the past but guess what were my problems (a) weird people on there, see potentially abusive partners everywhere (b) I don't even really know what I want in a relationship as said it probably would be just stupid right now (c) I'm absolutely boring, I don't really have a life after all. I wouldn't mind dating someone as boring as me but what are you supposed to talk with a person like that. Awkward silence because both people are boring as death? I can have conversations with people about Uni related stuff for hours, great, but this doesn't make me get to know people at all! I wouldn't mind answering a couple questions about myself but I guess it's mostly going to bore the other person.

Now I know it's stupid to start a relationship or anything like that in my current situation since it could only go wrong. But it honestly doesn't change the fact that I always end up developing feelings for someone who in my eyes showed me a bit more attention than the average Joe. It sucks. It's really painful. I don't want this anymore. I now ended up crushing on an Anime character. I guess it's stupid but maybe you can figure how desperate I am in that regards...



And lastly the feeling very lost part. I guess I mentioned it a couple times already but I really don't see a nice feature anymore. If I survive until then I will graduate in a couple years. It will probably just be painful to look back and realize that I mostly wasted these years too. I can't look back at all, even right now. But if I try to look into the future I just see the same void I expect to see in my past. I am feeling fucking done.



Ok my rant is over. I guess I got more negative towards the end, sorry for writing all this shit here but it had to leave my head (although I don't expect it to not actually bother me again in like a couple hours or so you know). In case anyone is worrying I'm not actively suicidal because I still have some kind of (irrational) hope, I'm just in a lot of pain...



Best regards

Sa-chan

Feeling Down...,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/feeling-down.122265/,Not sure why. Not sure if it's from my dream last night or because my youngest kept me up most of the night or something else.  I don't know.
I just need a friend.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/i-just-need-a-friend.121866/,"I don't come on SF anymore until I get really down. Which I guess is good. I've been fighting this wave of depression like there's no tomorrow. Look I made a suicide pun.



But I can't shake it. It's tearing me apart. I don't even care if my girlfriend comes over anymore. She still does, but it wouldn't matter if she didn't. I've distanced myself from everyone again. I hate this. I just want it to go away. I'm tired of feeling like this. It's not all the time anymore, which I guess is good. But when it comes back? Oh god, it comes back. I guess that's what depression is. 



I'm twenty-two years old now. When I first joined SF I was barely 15 and hanging on by a thread. I had written myself a promise that I would not make it to my sixteenth birthday and even though I tried many times, somehow I'm still here. There has to be a reason, right?



Some days I look at myself and I'm proud of everything I've accomplished, but other days..? Other days I sit here and wallow in the fact that I am still alive. When friends ask me how I'm doing I say tired, even though it's more than just your casual tired feeling. I'm tired alright, but I'm tired of life, which I feel like is a different sort of tired. 



I'm waiting to wake up one day and be completely fine. I want those days where yeah, shit happens but it's not the end of the world instead of dreading waking up. Instead of having to force myself to get out of bed in the morning..or sometimes in the afternoon..or sometimes in the evening. 



I miss having actual friends. People I could talk to when I was down and count on them to pick me back up again. But this? This is hell. 



How are you?



I'm tired, but I'm okay. How are you? 



And then I listen to how they are because they don't know any better anymore and I'm not about to tell them I'm on the verge of suicide. I'm not about to tell them I have planned this out again. 



It's odd how time flies and your plans when you were a kid seem so childish so you come up with new inventive plans. But in the end? It's still wrong. Why should any human feel the need to take their own life? What is that?



I stopped taking my medication again. Cold turkey. Almost three months ago and for the past almost month I can feel it.



I don't even cry anymore, but tonight? Tonight I'm bawling. 



Tonight I'm sat here on the floor in my closet of all places and I'm fucking bawling. I don't understand. 



I don't understand at all."
Bullied/Anxiety/School/Alone,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/bullied-anxiety-school-alone.122534/,"Today was back to school after 2 weeks off, most people just hate going back because of learning, but its different with me. I'm scared to walk the halls without being pushed over or insulted, I'm scared to put my hand up in lessons for fear of being wrong and being made fun of, I'm scared to be alone for too long as I feel like everyone is staring at me. I'm really insecure about my looks and feel like i'm ugly and horrible and that no-one actually likes me. My self-esteem is horrible. My anxiety kills me. I can barely complete the simplest of tasks without having worrying or crying. And last night I spent hours curled up crying, trying not to hurt myself over going back to school, I tried to convince myself I would be fine. But it was all lies.



Today I got up and I skipped breakfast and spent my time in the bathroom putting as many different types of spot cream and dirt cleansers as I could as I have a lot of acne. I hate looking at myself in the mirror and seeing my ugly, spotty face. I try my best to use my fringe to hide my face and eyes away.



Then when I got on the bus to go to school I started shaking and crying quietly because I was so scared of going to school. 



When I got to school and it was time for forms (20 minute registration classes at start of the day) I saw everyone else in my form standing with their friends, waiting to go in, chatting away, but as usual I stood by myself. Then when we went inside for form I sat in my seat in silence and only spoke when my name was called out on the register. I even hate hearing my name being called out for fear of being stared at.



In first lesson (maths) we had moved seats and the teacher put us in new places, I got put next to 3 other girls who I didn't talk to really, but I could tell they didn't want me sitting with them. Then in 2nd lesson (PE) I took off my school blouse to put my PE shirt on and all my scars were on display. No-one said a word but i caught one of my friends staring as I quickly put on my PE jacket to cover them up. This term we were doing football  Needless to say I'm horrible at pretty much every sport. We got into small groups and did dribbling practise but I felt as if everyone was watching me the whole lesson as I was slow and really bad.



At lunch (after 4th lesson) I sat down, none of my friends had turned up yet, so I sat by myself. This boy who I knew came up to me and asked if he could sit with us, some of my friends didn't like him but I wanted to be nice and I had nothing against him so I let him sit with us. About 15 minutes later these boys came up to us and started bullying him (like they usually do), then because I was sitting next to him they started picking on me too. It hurt more than anyone could think. I let everyone else's words get to me. I hate myself for that. I froze up and sank in my seat, letting them keep throwing words at me until the bell went for next lesson. I just couldn't stand up for myself, no matter how much I wanted to.



In 5th lesson (biology) our teacher made certain students (including me) stand up and tell a fact about enzymes, and although she knew I was really shy and I struggled a bit (because I had only just joined top set this year) she left me until last and I couldn't give a fact. Everyone watched me and eventually the teacher told me to sit down and went onto explaining today's lesson. I bet everyone didn't care about the fact I couldn't give a fact but it stayed in my mind and I kept thinking that they were all staring at me and judging me. 



On the bus home this girl, who was behind me, started whispering my name, taking my bag away and hiding it, pulling/messing with my hair and saying things to me. I didn't say much back. I just sunk back into my seat, turned up the music in my headphones and stared out the window. Even though It was all jokes it hurt me and I just wanted to be left alone. 



When I got home I just started crying and just started talking and cuddling with my rabbits and cried. I feel like they are the only ones that listen. My friends say I can talk to them but I'm scared to because I feel like I'm bothering them, that I'm making everything about me and that they really don't care about me. My brain is really hurting. I can't sleep, I barely get any sleep nowadays. I keep trying to not eat and drink. I haven't drunk anything in a few days. And I haven't eaten anything for nearly two days. Luckily I've been clean for a few days but I'm scared I'll break that record tonight  I just hate myself and no matter what anyone says or does to comfort me I just feel like I'm alone and that no-one cares. My head takes over me.



 Thanks for reading if you got this far, it means a lot. This is only scratching the surface of how I feel"
Disappointed In A Part Of This Site,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/disappointed-in-a-part-of-this-site.122652/,"I started to get excited when I saw 'Suicide, 10 methods to die'. I know I don't read things properly because I'm so distracted with pain but I really did have some hope there until I read it. I thought it would give hope to people like me with proper decent advice on how to end your life. There are people like me who are desperate to go, I mean DESPERATE to die. Seeing that written on this site gave me the biggest buzz in years that I might get decent advice. But it turned out to be a cruel lie. It was not a method in how to end your suffering. It was some kind of information on what makes people want to die. Well anyone coming on this site knows only too well what makes people want to die. People like me don't want to be persuaded to live we just want help in ending it as it's so painful to live this life. In my case it's mainly physical pain and feeling trapped that makes me want to die. I am alone, without help and disabled in my flat and ignored mainly by the state. They give me meds for my physical condition which has no effect and I have not got out of my flat in over a decade. I would have done a lot better if I had committed some awful crime and been doing time in a prison cos they let you have an hour of sun there a day I've been lead to believe. I used to be a sun worshiper and it worked as an anti-depressant for me when I was out on my bike all the time. The nearest I get to the sun is seeing it on the net. I'm very bitter about my situation and just want to not be here. I have no friends, no nothing except a very aware brain that makes every second of this living hell feel like a million years. The awful thing is I think I've got a reasonably funny personality and can have a laugh but anyone who had to endure my life for the past 11 years would be crying all the time as it's been horrific due to me not getting proper medical attention and also being abused for years by a boyfriend I was relying on for help. Just saying, don't give people hope when there is none... it's downright mentally cruel, really cruel cos I thought any advice on this site would be proper medical advice on how to die in the best way possible with no pain, cos after all the only reason I want to get out is because I'm in intense pain."
Hate Towards Skinny People,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/hate-towards-skinny-people.122307/,"Hey guys. Something happened to me a couple of nights ago and it's really stuck with me ever since. I guess I mainly need to vent, but I'm hoping that I can also find some reassurance and hope.



First of all, I suppose it's relevant to say that I'm kind of skinny, and I have been my whole life. I feel it's important to mention that I am NATURALLY skinny, despite the fact I did also suffer from an eating disorder in my teen years. At school, I would starve myself. So, naturally, my classmates would think that my small frame was entirely due to the fact that I never ate. This would be an understandable assumption to make, however, I am just a thin girl in general. I am in remission from my eating disorder and have been for almost a decade, and yet I am still thin, because it's just how my body naturally is. However, whenever I try to explain this to people, even people who I thought weren't the judgemental type, they would still look at me in disbelief and dismiss the idea. It's quite bizarre really, because I could eat as much as I want in front of people when I finally became comfortable with it, and they would still assume that my skinny frame was to do with some kind of mental illness like bulimia. It's very frustrating to have this label pinned on me for as long as I remain thin.



This has been an infuriating topic for me for a long time, ever since the media got involved. It became fashionable to be a ""curvy"" girl, and if you were skinny then you weren't a ""real girl"". This is still very true today, and I witness this sickening show too regularly for me to handle. It's all well and good to empower women who may not have felt comfortable in their skin because they thought they were a little overweight, but to shun and spread hate towards skinny girls in the process is disgusting to me. Yes, it's great to spread awareness of being healthy, as in, eating right and exercising, but a lot of people seem to have no idea that healthy bodies can come in all shapes and sizes. I eat a lot more than people might imagine, and I exercise regularly, and because I am still thinner than average, people assume that I'm sick or that there's something wrong with me, or that I need to eat MORE in order to look ""normal"".



While this has angered me for many years, it never really bothered me to the point of taking action, because I knew that there would always be people in this world who would be judgemental and ignorant. So I just let it happen, I let it slide, and focused on the people who cared for me and believed in me. However, the one person I thought I could trust the most, ended up becoming one of the judgemental types.



My best friend couldn't stop commenting on my weight when I saw her a few days ago. She kept staring at me, making me hugely uncomfortable. It even looked like she had a hint of disgust in her eyes. She said that I needed to eat more, that I needed to put on more weight, that I looked sick. While I understand that she may have been concerned because she thought I genuinely wasn't eating enough, the truth was that I had been eating plenty, and I was finally getting to the point where I felt really good about myself, until she broke that all down with just a few words and looks. I'm still so taken aback, because until now she was never the sort of person to bring another person down for something as superficial as looks.



I now have a stupid desire to eat more junk food and to actually gain weight in a massively unhealthy way just so I can get those judgemental eyes off me, which is surely the opposite effect that people should be going for. I now hate the way I look, despite the fact that I am the healthiest I have ever been. I feel like I've gone back to my teen years, despising what I see in the mirror just because I don't fit society's standards of what a ""real girl"" should look like. Not once in my life have I shunned a certain body type, not once have I judged someone for being overweight. Yet when a girl is underweight or even just a bit thin like I am, then it seems like it's perfectly acceptable to throw insults around. Do skinny girls not have feelings? Why is it hugely shocking to insult an overweight girl, but everyone laughs and claps when a skinny girl gets the hate? I'm getting to the point of wondering if anyone even sees me as a human being any more. I try so hard to treat my body with all the respect it deserves, especially after how poorly I treated it during my teen years, and just because I haven't gained the weight that people expect me to, I'm still just a disgusting twig in their eyes.



I'm sorry for venting so much. I'm hoping that I'm not alone here, because right now, that's how I feel."
"Burn out, but can't stop.",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/burn-out-but-cant-stop.107822/,"I am so extremely weary. Fighting to get my clients what they are owed and need to survive is getting so much harder. Kafka would be proud. The Victim blaming rhetoric is really starting to get me angry. Moronic people with no clue are getting me even more irate to the point I want to savage their lives and plunge them into poverty and mental illness just to watch them suffer and be vilified and watch their bigoted self delusions shatter on the jagged edge of reality. Then laugh at them with contempt and scorn when they come to me for help. â€œI am sorry due to funding cuts you are on your own. I would direct you to other services but they have gone under. Please now rely on 'Big Society.' born of political spin and equally as empty.  If that means starvation and death well that is your own fault for some reason I can't fathom, but apparently it is.  Be careful not to become homeless as it is the equivalent of being a criminal. But you can legally sleep in a snow bank.â€ù



I go to bed angry and wake up angry. This anger is seeping into everything. It is useful to an extent. It allows me to wage psychological warfare and be so persistently stubborn I may as well be the earth's axis. But the earth's Axis does not get demoralised or suffer burn out or need to eat. I am haunted by the dead and the stories they told. Aware how badly they were treated and how they do not exist in official statistics. But their gravestones and family grief is very real regardless of what the numbers don't say and government tries to cover up. Seems compassion and human decency is no longer cost effective. I am so tired but I cannot stop. Compassion and rage are food for the fight but I am exhausted. It has certainly affected my capacity to write and sleep."
Did you know?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/did-you-know.122675/,"im just tired. it never ends. either I am depressed one day or angry the next. Im never happy. Im barely ever ""content"". and thats all I want....is to be emotionally neutral. completely void, un-exaggeratingly apathetic. (not sure if that is a word but it is now). motivation for more than rehearsals, for more than finding the perfect place for my body to be discovered. how about motivated to wake up. not even for work, not for school but just to know for once in my life I don't feel remorse and regret about still being alive and that no matter how hard I try I can never possibly put into words how empty I feel and how despite this all I want is more emptiness."
Why won't people just let me talk?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why-wont-people-just-let-me-talk.122004/,"I spoke to my therapist, her immediate reaction was to put me on a hold.  I spoke to my PCP, her reaction was to panic and get a therapist who considered putting me on a hold (I kept most details private). I told a friend and again, panic instead of letting me talk.  I have been as far as having plan and date time to complete it, that was two weeks ago.  I still struggle with the thoughts, but without the obsessiveness. 



I flat out told the professionals that if you started writing those holds I would leave.  All you were doing was causing me to go into hiding, probably in a hotel, without being able to contact anyone.  Not exactly what I needed.  



Yes its scary stuff, but I thought with my therapist I would be safe enough to speak the whole truth.  We worked it out in the end, but I still have some misgivings.

"Very dangerous mood swings, please help",https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/very-dangerous-mood-swings-please-help.122741/,"Hi. I didnt want to create this thread but now I feel like I have to.

I take comcerta for attention deficit disorder. I feel like my mood is changing dangerously. I feel powerful and suicidal, both of these moods last hours.

I wanted to give medication time to see if this effect would go.

Also I was very depressed when I first started my therapy for adhd. It was one or two months ago and I was so depressed I wasnt even able to wash my face.

So I feel like medication isnt the only cause of my problem but it makes my mood very worse.



What do you think, should I stop medication or should I call my psychiatrist?



We have only strattera, medikinet, ritalin and concerta here. I tried them all. I have no other choice left. This is why I am afraid to call my psychiatrist.

Thought I did the right things...,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/thought-i-did-the-right-things.121924/,"I'm still at my mum's place... which is a bad place for me to be... but sometimes you have to certain things... tomorrow we're going to an intimate family lunch... well, just the 4 of us in my closest family. 



I did a lot of things to navigate through the day... My aunt came to visit as my mother was cooking pancakes... my aunt is constantly negative about anything and anyone while she just sits on her bum... and won't listen when mum tells her not to chase the dog around the house... he's getting old... and she overfeeds the cats, and one of them has digestive problems... I guess she means well... but yea. 



I did things to avoid arguments from happening... small things like me going to get her coat from my mum's bedroom... the cats are not allowed in there, but my aunt never remembers to close the door behind her. When my aunt was complaining about stuff I found the silver lining... 



And I took the dog for a walk, for my own sake too... I needed air, and I guess sunshine is healthy for you. Both physically and mentally. 



The dog loves to go to the field next to mum's house... there's a road there and he's allowed to run on the field without a leash. (technically legally you're not allowed to let a dog loose on public ground though) But no one ever comes there... well almost never. 



Walking back home the school where I was severely bullied for 8 years and sexually abused was in full view... If you wanted to take a promotional picture of that school you would do that from the top of that field... I gulped. But I got a bright idea... I sat myself down on the side of the road, called the dog over; had music in one ear and calmed myself as much as I could and forced myself to look at the buildings... Technically it's just bricks and mortar now... but I need to get over my mortal fear. I get so sick when I get too close and that's not fair I have to be 26 and be so dead afraid of a school I left when I was 14. 



But suddenly the dog ran away from me... and what was actually a sort of good moment became one of stress. Two women had found the road and decided to walk it with their tiny dog... I can't blame them, it's a pretty walk... Micky, my mum's dog ran from me towards them. He LOVES people... he thinks they all love him. He hadn't noticed the dog... I walked after him... I can't run because of my spine and hip and tried to command him to stop. He did but just as I was about to click the leash on him he ran again... he actually reached the women and I managed to call out to them that he's not dangerous... 

One lady took their dog in her arms and the other one caught Micky. Luckily he was wearing a brace so he was easy to grab and was just wagging his tail. I told them I was so sorry and they took it pretty well. 



It just undid what I tried to do... 



I don't know... I feel a bit weird tonight. Thinking back I am realizing I did all the wrong things. 

I was one again avoiding by changing my aunts subjects, helping my mum extra in the kitchen so my mum would get less frustrated about my aunt... I stepped right back into my old role... 





I was told to focus on doing things I like, things that make me happy... not what other people expect of me. Or even what I assume that they expect. The therapist I talked to at the psych ER a week ago told me that. As things are right now, with me starting therapy and opening up so many bottled things and so much abuse; the last thing I need is to fulfill others expectations... I need to be kind to me. And I undid all that today. 



I have to admit it feels a bit weird... but in a way it makes sense. I just feel like I'm supposed to be a 'good girl' and get a job and work hard... my mum told me they were seeking a medical secretary at an ear doctor in this town. I told her I'd look at it. 

I won't though... I know I can't work now... I wish I could, but I can't... and this entire town feels like a trigger. I am always scared I'll meet someone who used to bully me. I still have my dentist here, one of the assistants is one of those girls. 



Ear doctors are another trigger for me... I had a really nice ear doctor as a kid... I have always had really bad ears and have had so many infections and had to have operations to drain fluids... today I am almost deaf on one ear and partially deaf on the other... Under one of the sessions with the ear doctor when I was around 10 he drained my ears with a very noisy apparatus and by accident ruptured my eardrum. After that I felt actual dread having to go there... I even threw up before sessions... During one session mum managed to drag me to I was covering my ears and screamed ""don't touch me!!"" 

And we stopped coming... I went to an ear doctor a few years ago... as a grown woman and I felt just as sick. I had told the ear doctor about my fears and she was really nice about it.  And it turns out my hearing was a lot better than I knew. 

So uhm... yeah... don't really think I'll work at such a place. 



It does feel weird to focus on me rather than finding work (to be perfectly honest I would rather live off of writing or something similar from home rather than having to work).  I just don't think I'm cut out for a job. But who knows who I'll be when I've been helped? 



So... I am supposed to fill my life with things I like to do... luckily filming of my favourite TV show is starting very, very soon and I'll be following that daily online... that always gives me a rush. I spend my days talking to my LDR boyfriend, I try to do things like draw and I hope to get back to crocheting and maybe even painting! I am tempted to when I feel better and see what it takes to get into an acting school as well. I took all the acting classes I could in school... it gave me a great chance to be someone else; and it helped me with my stutter brought on by bullying. 



I just... yeah... it takes times to get used to the idea that it's okay to do things that makes me happy, and not what others expect. I lived my entire life trying to be a good girl... hoping if I was someone might like me... or at least not hit me."
I'm sorry,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/im-sorry.121954/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place but I didn't really know where to put it...

That should I fail, I will be subjected to the whim of fate, hoping that some driven enough and foolish enough lifts me from my willful trek towards hopelessness, the alternate fate of my mother. It may simply be a result of my lazy nature coupled with my disconsolate disposition. In reality I may simply be suffering from depression. 



At any rate this is how the story goes. About a month ago I started noticing it was harder to focus. I have AD/HD and focus is hard to come by as it is but the inability was novel. No matter how hard I tried, nothing I attempted could manage to bring my focus in long enough to be productive. Even when I could strong arm my mind into focusing my brain seemed incapable of comprehending the most simple tasks. I couldn't read. There has been several dozen situations in the last month where I would sit down for a minimum of an hour and get nothing done, whether it was reading, writing, researching. WHATEVER. The closest thing I'd gotten to success was with ""reading"". I would stare at some form of written material and bounce my eyes from one word to the next but it was as though I was reading some foreign language.



School is almost over(in 2 weeks) I dont think I can call for an incomplete and I am spending all of my energy just trying to just stay alive, not run away, not relapse into drugs. I can't do amy work anymore but I feel like I can't tell anyone because they would just dismiss it as being lazy. And I am afraid they would be right.



I just don't know what to do anymore and as I move forward I often find my myself contemplating how such an inability will play itself out moving forawrd. It usually starts off in my mind as failing a class, then failing multiple classes, then dropping out of school as a result of lack of motivation, and then getting a deadend/minimum wage job at mcdonalds, followed some time down the line by an eclipsing depression based in the fact that my life has become the punch line of some tragic joke, and eventually commiting suicide. This is all to say that by that point I have not already relapsed into major drug abuse and am either in jail, fatally overdosed, or trapped in some form of permanent psychosis as a result of drug abuse or the degenerative nature of schizophrenia. 



I do not want to commit suicide but life is beginning to seem progressively more and more pointless and I fear my already lacking willpower will not be enough to prevent me from acting out of impulse. Although I hate the idea of me living no more would the world stop turning? Even if the lives of several hundered (a liberal estimate) were affected by my self destruction would the world not someday and someday soon move on and forget about me as it does with most everyone else. Even if it were just my family to feel the pain would whatever family I have whereever down the line not feel the pain? One way or another we are all headed there eventually, and our loved ones should we be so fortunate will all feel it eventually. What is the point of enduring so much pain and senseless confusion and agony for only a relatively minor amount of joy/satisfaction of the course of such time?



In my mind if one cannot positively and significantly effect a number of lives that sums up to a number greater than they would hurt if they were dead is a waste of resources. I hate the fact that I look at life so mathematically, black/white, emotionally irrelevant, but it is how I truly view the world and it terrifies me. But what terrifies me even more is the fact that I am growing to accept this way of thinking as fact, no longer as simply the whimperings of my poor depressed soul."
Another hard crash,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/another-hard-crash.122713/,"It has been awhile since I have posted. I have recently crashed hard. unsure how to put it.  Quit living would be best I suppose. lost job, lost friends, lost home. This has occurred over the course of 4 months. All the while I put up a front of happiness and stability.

I am shaky and afraid. 

 Was released from the hospital about ten hrs ago. (Currently in a safe place) Go back in the morning for my fourth ECT treatment. Spent 2 weeks on the psych ward after I was determined to be a threat/harm to myself. This is now the second time that the police have brought me in. Currently on 4 different meds.

Feeling very ashamed...unsure if I have the strength to get through this.....very ashamed"
Selfdestructive thoughts,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/selfdestructive-thoughts.121900/,"Hi everyone,



I'm having a really bad day, I need to talk to someone before I lose it.



I keep having these repetitive negative thoughts that are making me depressed. I've been insecure all my life, and it feels like its getting worse. ""I'm worthless, I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough, I am a burden to others"". And lately I've been having suicidal thoughts again. ""Just do it, nobody will miss me, it will be better if you're out of their lives"". I'm afraid that one day I can't stand it anymore. I don't want this, I want to be happy, I want to make my partner happy. Trying so hard to change myself, but the more I try the more upset I get that I'm not moving forward fast enough. I'm afraid I'll never change. My partner is the sweetest guy ever. He's been really patient with me, but I see he's losing his patience. He acts cold now when I'm feeling sad, doesn't ask whats wrong. And I completely understand. If you see someone sad everytime, you'll get tired of it. I'm so afraid I'll lose him. And whats hurting me the most, I keep telling myself that. ""Youre losing him. Look hes upset with you, he must be tired of you. He's going to leave you"". I want these thoughts to stop, I cant take it anymore. I dont know what to do.."
Why can't they see I'm doing them a favour?,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why-cant-they-see-im-doing-them-a-favour.122118/,"The Suicide/Depression Paradox hurts me.



It just strikes me as weird that the way the general public views depression and suicide actually works to suffering people feel even more unworthy of life. 



On the one hand: people tell me that I have a moral or ethical duty to live, and not just to live, but to be happy and productive. Even though I have no family that wants anything to do with me, no friends whatsoever, no pets, a job I hate that expires in June and no prospects of getting another job. But must live like this and like it, out of adherence to an abstract social pronouncement.



On the other hand: people tell me that depressed and suicidal people like me are the worst people ever. That they don't want me around, they won't love or befriend me, help me or even talk to me. I've been called a shithead, a worthless piece of shit, a bullshit artist, an ingrate, a retard, a coward, a cop-out, a criminal (and that's just my mother!). They sneer at me for not going to a therapist and also scorn me for not being able to fix myself on my own (this is my step-father and sister). 



People say I want to be depressed, it's all my fault because I'm actively trying to be unhappy, out of spite to them or because I was spoiled when young. I'm told I'm not unhappy because of  physical or emotional abuse nor my social awkwardness; and besides, I invite that on myself for being unhappy.



So if I'm so awful, why do I have this weird duty to live? Isn't such a failure of a human being doing everyone a favour by taking herself out of their way? My family/ acquaintance/ culture isn't even religious so it's not as though they're working within a moral framework that accepts adherence to this type of rule. And this paradox is the only one that exists, the only one without moral grey areas."
Why??,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/why.121998/,"I'm struggling and I really just need to vent......



Why do anything in our life's??? Everything and I mean everything is just passing time until the end comes........study,work,reading,

Watching tv, going for a walk.....it's all just to pass time.....and don't get me wrong I know some of those activities bring success enjoyment at fun and some don't.



Yes some are more time wasters than others.....but it's still all the same......



I hate my brain its my own worst enemy.



I try n think of things to do and then I get about a million different reasons as to why it's pointless and shouldn't do it.



I'm tied.....and my soul and brain need a rest as well....."
No sleep due to pain,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/no-sleep-due-to-pain.122302/,"So I went to bed 'early' (meaning midnight) because I have a therapy session today and wanted to have some sleep behind me to help me be more robust... 



Of course my back and hip wouldn't allow that ro happen. 



Chronic pain sucks so bad sometimes"
mental illness sucks.,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/mental-illness-sucks.121916/,"tonight i feel I'm at my ends. I feel like this endless battle should really be ending soon. Do i sound suicidal? To be honest with you, i am not sure if i want to die or just be numb. I am sick of fighting... i feel so sad and angry all at the same time."
Just venting,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/just-venting.122718/,"I feel so empty, hollow. Everything feel so meaning less. I just wish I had someone anyone that actually wanted to talk to me. Instead of me ALWAYS harassing people. I spend hours debating if I should post or not...I am so worthless and not worth anything. Yet I still crave having somebody that actually wants to talk to me. I'm so lonely. I hate being desperate yet it's all I feel I am. Nothing seem to have much meaning for me . Everything is so dark my heart feels black, I'm not sure I'll ever get it back. I hate myself more than anyone ever could."
Just some venting. (Replies welcome),https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/just-some-venting-replies-welcome.122683/,"So the problem is that I always feel so conflicted about everything. I always feel like I'm going to make a mistake or make the wrong decision. If i don't have someone standing behind me and telling me what to do, I don't do anything because I don't know what to do. The other problem is that on top of the fact that I feel like a failure, I feel like I just annoy everyone. In fact, I KNOW that I annoy everyone. I mean when you start talking and everyone just turns away, it's a really big sign that you're annoying, right? Everyone hates me. 



I don't have anyone to talk to about it. My only friends are Audrey and Shannon, and I think even try get sick of me some times. Anyways, I can't tell Audrey about how I feel, she goes through it too so she has herself to worry about. And she'll just think I'm obnoxious trying to talk to her while she's trying to deal with her own problems. I can't talk to Shannon, she just talks about how God will help me or whatever, and I just don't believe that. On top of that, she is going through a lot right now anyways, she doesn't need to have to worry about me too. And I can't talk to my family about it. They think it's just all my fault that I feel this way, everything is my fault. They say I'm just lazy and a liar and all this stuff. They don't believe in me, they don't think I can do anything right. I tell them how I feel and they tell me to suck it up. They won't take me to see a therapist anymore because the last therapist I went to didn't help me, which is of course my fault. 



The insecurities are the worst though. I think they cause most of the anxiety. I'm insecure about my personality: I feel like I'm annoying and sometimes off-standish, and so I get anxiety in any social situation. I'm super insecure about my body. Oh my god, that's the worst. I'm always sucking in my stomach trying to be skinnier and trying not to jiggle. I don't want to give people a reason to make fun of me. I try to lose weight and I just fail at it. I'll exercise for a few days but then lose motivation. I eat all the time. I can't control myself. If I'm sad, I eat, and I'm sad all the time. I just wish I could be skinny. I wish I could be less annoying. I wish I could actually do something right for once. I wish I didn't feel like such a failure. I just wish I wasn't me."
Life/Death,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/life-death.122483/,"Life has been hard and I find myself wishing I was dead. But for some reason,  I fear death when the suicidal thoughts aren't there.  I don't know why, I think I may die soon anyways. Not sure how, but the thoughts are there. I don't know  how to stop thinking of death or how it may be. I just want to enjoy life and those that are in it instead of dreading every moment of it and being scare of death to begin with. Some times, I don't understand myself."
Meds - Forgetting,https://www.suicideforum.com/community/threads/meds-forgetting.122075/,Realized that I forgot to take my meds yesterday. Took it this morning.  Everything towards the end of the day was crashing down on me emotionally.  I started getting suicidal thoughts again.  Better today.  I just got to remember to take my meds on time.
