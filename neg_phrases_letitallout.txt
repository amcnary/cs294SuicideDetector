there is
maybe
 and there is leave me the eff alone
i have a great family
 but one that crawls under my skin
tells me to lose her number
 a few months later your all i have/had i want us to be ok and be family again
other words in my dictionary
avoid
 make excuses
 lie
actually bad week
 i just need to vent
 i'm so tired of this depression and anxiety
 i felt good for awhile then i wake up one morning back to square one
  dark depression and anxiety to the point i don't want to leave the house and can't get anything done
 i wish i were normal
 when i look at the problems "normal " people have i'm envious
 some of them are laughable
 they would probably think my irrational fears are laughable too
 that's what makes it so damn frustrating
 there's nothing outside to be afraid of (except a public panic attack) i'm tired of no motivation
 everything looks/feels empty and futile
 the same idiotic daily grind day in day out
 i'm sure it'll pass
sooner or later
sooner i hope
 i know there's no answers
 just wanted to complain with a post
 i hope everyone is doing better than i am today
 you're all good people and i'm sorry you suffer this curse of depression/anxiety and all the other mental tortures that have descended on you
love you
 bless you
brian
i went into a crisis center on friday afternoon and spent two hours talking to a therapist
  i told her if she started to write an m1 hold i would leave at the start of our session
 she was the best therapist i have had since seeking treatment
  she was angry that i had talked my way out holds in mid-march
  she told me my charm and the kindness of therapists was not helpful for me
she was too good
  always had a counter argument
 outmaneuvered me consistently
 forced me to see how damaging my own words were
  she broke me down
she wrote the hold and i eventually left before police could arrive to stop me
 she told me multiple times that i need time for myself
 that i was not getting better and should allow others to care for me for a little while
  i was terrified at the thought
right now i am unstable after a better day saturday
  i won't have anyone to talk to
 maybe for awhile which is the main cause
  future worry but i know how i get when there are gaps in therapy
 hell i'm not doing so great right now
the weird thing is that i work in mental health
  i see therapists
 nurses and prescribers every day
  but i also have lots of conflict due to some of these people being aware that i am in treatment
  that also creates anxiety due to privacy concerns
this therapist called my office today and even though she did not say it
 i know she recognized my voice
ive been tearing up at my desk for hours now
  this lack of anonymity
 along with the reasons i went into that specific crisis center are making me feel panicked
i need to talk but tuesday may be the earliest i will see my current t
that's as much as i write for now and i hope it is enough
recently
 i was conversing with a friend of mine
 she had been committing self-harm
 and i had been trying to talk her out of it
 eventually
 she realised what she was doing wasn't the way to go about things (not a serious case
 this was simply a teenage drama
 so it was quite easy to push her through)
i get the bus home
 i'm feeling good
 i go up into my room and started vibing to some gorillaz
 then i get a text
"i hate you"
"what
"it just sunk in"
"still confused"
"you're hideous matthew"
"i mean
 yeah
 but can you tell me what's up
"stop
"did your boyfriend (yes
 she had a "boyfriend"
 as much as you can have one at my age
 pathetic really) show you a picture of me killing a puppy or something
 i can assure you
 i only eat the ones from the butchers"
"shut up
so i did just that
 i shut up
as you can probably tell
 i was pretty weirded out
 she'd seemed fine no more than 5 minutes ago
 what had got her panties in a twist
 low and behold
 no less than 30 seconds after putting my phone down
 i get a call
i hear a gruff
 male voice on the other side of the phone
"hello
is this matthew barbara
 (yes
 he said barbara)"
 it's his cousin steve"
he paused for a bit
 so he wasn't that much of a worry intelectually
"don't play your games with me kid
 i know what's going on
"sorry sir
 but i have no idea what you're talking about
"i know what you've been doing
 kid
 you've been head****ing my daughter
 sir-"
"stop head****ing my daughter
i heard crying in the background
"have a good day you manipulative little freak
it's now been a week
 and i haven't seen this friend anywhere
 they don't answer their phone
 every contact i had with her has been blocked
 and now i'm kind of like
whoops
i am sitting at my desk trying to calm myself down and hating myself for being stupid
 and normally when i say stupid i am talking about some emotionally driven decision or action - and i am that kind of stupid on an almost perpetual basis
 i have basically come to terms with being 'that kind of stupid'
the kind of stupid that reduces me to tears of frustration and self loathing is the "how can you not fucking get this
" kind of stupid
 usually involving some kind of math/data
so if i have something that costs å£35 and i want to make a 65% margin i need to take my å£35 and divide it by 0
 å£35/0
35 = å£100
 fine
 but if i sell it for å£70 i have made 100% profit
 my md tells me that gp (gross profit) is the same as margin
 how can that be true
 if my profit is 100% but my margin in that instance would be 50%
i am not really expecting anyone to explain this to me - apparently i am far too fucking stupid to understand if you try
 believe me
 people have tried
 i just really needed to vent before i cry at my desk
i first met my best friend in
 i think it was 2005
  she was the new kid nobody knew and i was the weird kid nobody liked
 so we were pretty much destined to pair up on the first project of the school year
  we hit it off pretty much right away and were best friends throughout middle school until she moved about 350 miles away from where i lived at the time
we remained best friends through high school by texting
 connecting on facebook and writing each other long letters
  she occasionally came to visit my hometown with her family
  i'd see her at those times
  through most of my rocky college experience leading up to my move
 we stayed close (although i felt reluctant to tell her about depression and suicidal feelings like i did before
)  that was when things changed
when i was planning my move to san francisco
 i was really nervous
  this was a huge step in my life
 and i wanted her to know about it
  so i texted her about it
  i didn't tell her specifically to keep it a secret
 but it was kind of a given
 considering the things i mentioned about my parents
i don't remember how long after that the next part happened
 but it couldn't have been more than a few days
  my parents received a phone call at approximately 11pm
 maybe later
  i knew something was wrong right away
  my parents told me the next morning that it had been my best friend's mom saying that my best friend had told her i was planning something drastic
  my parents asked me a few things
  i confirmed nothing and denied suicide plans
  later i found out my parents had lied and knew of my upcoming move
  i asked my best friend about it and she said her mom must have gone through her phone
  i found out she'd lied too
 and she said she wasn't sorry
we stopped talking after that for a while until my counselor at the residential treatment program encouraged me to forgive her
  things were a little rocky at first
 but we got back to being best friends soon enough
  now i'm struggling in my relationship with her again
she's just so busy
 she hardly has time to talk to me
  i find it hard not to be upset at that
  (even though i know it's not really her fault
)  plus there's at least one other person she calls her "best friend"
  it might seem silly
 but i sometimes feel slighted when i see that on facebook
  i feel like maybe we could grow apart and i don't want that to happen
  sometimes i feel like she's only tolerating me
 but that's probably just my low self-esteem talking
i'm going to be moving within 300 miles of where she is soon
 but i get the feeling that no matter how close i get she'll still have trouble finding time to see me
i feel like garbage
 trash
 a big pile of nothing
 i am no good
 i am pathetic and don't even stand up to my own core principles
 i am nothing
 when i look in the mirror i see an empty husk who is nothing
what could i do to feel better
 i'm tired of feeling this way
 it hurts
what the fuck is wrong with you
i use to come on here all the time 
 i don't know what trigger me to come back
 i'm doing fairly well 
 i suppose it's cause easter just passed 
 i hate easter 
 it was the last time i saw my father 
 33yrs ago so not like this just happened but 
 he kidnapped me and quickly got caught which lead to several events and 2 yrs later he took his life 
 here's what is bothering me the most 
 all my life i remember that day with him bringing me a present 
 this pink huge crayola crayon holder thing 
 the toy doesn't exist 
 i can see it in my memory i can see it on the rug clear as day 
 my mom went along with me all these years talking about this dumb thing 
 but there's no toy 
 he brought me nothing
  i always had it in my head that he came with this grand toy and took me  kidnapped me because
 well 
 he loved me so much 
 but he took me to his house 
 where he would easily be found
 he took me to hurt my mother 
 none of it was about me 
 my last memory of my father 
 was all a lie 
sorry if this wasn't the right place for this 
 i just needed to get this out somewhere 
 but not to people that know me 
just venting - 
i'm easily pushed over my tolerance levels anymore
  i'm trying to get better and i am
 but sometimes things can send me into an anxiety-filled frenzy that is difficult to come out of
  it can feel like it won't end
once the anxiety raises then all else spirals
  triggers come unexpectedly and without me knowing what or why
and times like this
 i feel alone and sad and pathetic
  it is exhausting
  and all of this i would like to end
that's all
"why didn't you tell anyone
 "no one asked"
i'm so upset
 just seems like whenever my husband is off at work
 people just want to tell me off or whatever
  why can't this stuff happens when he's home or when he's with me
 am i just a target of everyone just telling me off that i don't know about
  just whatever
 i hate life
my grandfather was a musician
 for some reason
 this song causes me to cry uncontrollably
primarily because it was the last song my grandfather sang to me before he died
thought i'd share it with you guys
i'm only pretty to desperate or drunk people
i have more than most
 a loving relationship
 nice pets
 and a nice apartment in a beautiful city
 but i always come back to this debilitating depression
 i can't even walk out the door to go buy paper towels and dish soap
i feel hopeless
 unable to change focus from all of the pending threats in my life
 inevitable death of loved ones
 losing money
 having to always work and never being able to catch up or earn enough stability to have children
 in hopes of having someone and something bigger than myself to live for and to see something beautiful
 and focus on passing on the good things i've learned and value in myself
i'm unable to forgive my dysfunctional upbringing
 my mother who made me take care of her in alcoholism and drug abuse
 who even after 15 years clean
 struggles financially and in loneliness and illness
 putting weight on me as the only one to care for her
 i'm unable to forgive my younger brother
 who i thought my best friend in our shared experience of surviving our dysfunctional family
 but who instead has turned into a sociopath and narcissist
 who cut me out of his life without empathy or explanation
i feel myself in post trauma
 and tread so carefully in the friendships i've made as an adult
 but know i cannot help but come off as needy
 or sensitive
 or smothering
 i can only distract myself from my own suicidal ideations by throwing myself into helping others with resumes and job searches
 listening and advising to their stories
 which seem so trivial in comparison to mine
 but i feel some minor relief in pretending that my problems are that small and solvable
i feel some minor relief in pretending that i'm valuable to somebody
 even if they just are using me for help now
 and have no real interest in having an deeper friendship with me
i feel such anxiety not knowing if i'm hated
 or if people harbor resentment toward me for something i've done and am not aware of
 i'm so depressed
 i'm so sad
 i don't want to burden the few loved ones i have
 i can't bare to see happy families who have vacations
 and peers who visit their home towns and post images of dinners and respect and memories between siblings
i can't even connect with others who suffer from depression
 because theirs seem entirely biological or chemically-based
 they cycle through doctors and medication and i cannot relate because there do not seem to be any real events they can list as long and terrible as mine
 i've tried medication
 was misdiagnosed as several contrasting disorders by different doctors who didn't even attempt talk therapy
 or to learn about my life
 they just asked 10 questions and dolled out the meds
 which caused me to have hives
 wet the bed while i slept
 made me feel like i was having seizures
 and other unnatural experiences
 i know the only thing i would be interested in is talk therapy
 but the thought of trying to leave the house to meet so many disappointing mismatched therapists until i find one i can trust and respect seems impossible
 i feel tortured
i can't take this anymore
 life is full of disappointment and empty gestures
 of unreciprocated love
 and disrespect and dispiriting of women as they are
 and as they age
 it seems like there's no hope or anything to look forward to
 i've made it to my 30s
 i thought i just had experiential trauma from all of the dysfunctional family relationships growing up
 i thought i would outgrow this as a teenager
 as a college student under high stress
 as an adult considering children and a future
but i didn't
 i'll always feel this way
 i'll always want to die
i feel like i have always been taking care of them
 ever since i was a kid
 i am the peace maker and basically i make sure they don't kill one another
 my mom is always drunk and puts me and everyone else down
 even sometimes while sober
 she always needs to be the center of attention and to be involved in some sort of drama
 i can't imagine how many times i have told her to drop and forget about something from the past
 about me or another family member
 or even a friend or a neighbor
 only for her to bring it up once again
my mom told me i never do anything
 but i do so much
 if i didn't take out the trash
 do the dishes
 clean the house
 even her own room
 it would never get done because she never does any of it
 i left her alone for a week once
 and she couldn't even take out a single bag of garbage
 the place looked like a trash heap when i got back there
 not to mention
 she thinks that i am being influenced by "bad" people
 and referred to my friends as "assholes" even though she knows none of them
 i call it like i see it
 i try to give her a reality check
 but she gets offended
 she says i'm not allowed to discuss my feelings with anyone
 if i paint a less than perfect picture of her
 that's a problem
 but i only speak the truth
 and it's not like i can talk to her about these things
 because she just won't listen
why do i feel responsible for my family
 i guess i would feel guilty if something bad happened to them
 but that would be of their own doing
 i can't imagine why i put up with it
 unless i am just that defeated from years of mental/verbal abuse that i just accept it now
feeling exceptionally depressed
 i don't really know how to cope
 i haven't been talking to anyone specifically about my depression lately
 except for my counselor every 2 weeks
 and i haven't been talking to anyone in general
 really
 overall
 i just feel truly lonely
 i could talk to my family
 but to me
 for various reasons
 they're a last resort
 monitoring my diet is losing it's effectiveness in distracting me from my suicidal thoughts; it's just frustrating now
 exercise just feels like drudgery--go figure
 i feel like things will only get worse from now on
 i've had this ambition to at least pointlessly make it past another birthday
 even though it's just another shitty day
 in spite of all this
 i've yet to self-harm since december
 what am i doing
compared to the weekend this is nothing i suppose
but i'm just miserable
my sick back is acting up
 being worsened by mother natures cure to most females
 which in turn hurts in itself
 and is causing me mood swings
i am just having some weird thoughts on top of it
 i am listening to a prince song called 'free'
 i listened to it a lot when i was working my way away from my 'ex' idiot who abused me and forced me into prostitution
it has some really powerful lyrics
 to me at least
 and in my world 'the lonely monster' became my ex
and slowly i clawed myself back to life from a zombie like state
 a state where i mindless followed his orders
 too tired to even question it inwardly
 i didn't sleep for days
 late at night
 on top of it all he made me work on a site where i had to talk to horny men with all sorts of weird ideas in their heads and entertain them for money
i wasn't even a human being at that point
 i was a robot
 a slave
 and still now he can instill fear in me
but i got out
 thanks to my amazing boyfriend
 he truly saved my life
 and he's build me up from the bottom
 i am a person now
 i am a woman who can think for myself
 and no man has control of me
 my boyfriend refuses to make any decision for me
 he's the complete opposite of the idiot
i just hate that i allowed that to happen
 that i let that lonely monster take control of me
and another thing
 that time of the month always feels a little extra weird for me
 (sorry if squeamish guys are reading along) but my period was irregular for years
 i saw my doctor about it
 had my hormones tested
 i worried it was pcos
 but it wasn't
 however my doctor told me when i was 20 that i might not be able to conceive
 or at least struggle with it
 since i was very young i've had this big dream to have children
 well
 i haven't talked to a doctor about it since then
 but currently i'm regular like clockwork
 so it does make me hopeful
in a way i think my period might be a trigger too
 from when i was raped at 13
 i was late
 and i was so worried i had become pregnant
 (no one knew what had happened)
 it was a relief when i finally got it
 but it had been weeks of bad dreams waking up feverish thinking i was pregnant or had a baby
 or even miscarried
 i can still remember a very vivid dream of that
ah well
 i'll survive
 i guess
 i just need to pig out on some ice cream and chocolate
 right
i've had a not very nice tooth ache most of the day
 my mood the last few days has been dipping more and more
 i can't even explain how i feel right now
 i know i just want to be at home but i can't because i'm babysitting and will be for tonight and the next two nights while my friend and her partner at work
tomorrow night and thursday night a friend of my friend is going to be here as well
 i don't know him very well at all
i don't even want to do anything anymore i just want to curl up and rott away in my unit
 i don't want people to need me and i don't want to need others either
i feel so pathetic as a human i have done nothing useful for anybody or for myself
 i have nothing
i tried to have a bath because i don't have one at home but all i could do was stress
i really really don't want to do this thing called life anymore but i can't do anything about it at my friends house anyways
i'm just so tied of feeling so miserable
 i'm tied of everything about life
so i woke up at 6 am
 my alarm was set to 7
 but i think the sunrise might have woken me
 i went to the bathroom without turning the light on; i hoped i could crawl back to bed
 i had only had 5 hours of sleep (well 'only' is relative when some nights i only get 2 or less)
 but as i washed my hands i saw a weird shadow
 i guess my eyes weren't awake yet
 i panicked and ran to turn on the light
 i had to hide in the bathroom where it was now light
 gasping for air
 my heart racing
an hour later i went back to bed
 i sat on the edge first
 but fear gripped me again
 i sometimes get afraid of the 'monster' under the bed grabbing my legs
 yes
 i am 26 and i have those irrational fears sometimes still
i turned on my computer and the sun came up
 it became a very bright and sunny day
 and suddenly i just felt completely okay
i got my coffee and greek yogurt
 writing and joking with my boyfriend who came online at 8
 and suddenly i realized i was having a really
 really good day
 i didn't feel the dark cloud over my head that has followed me for so long
 and especially since the last time i saw my therapist
i have been so tired
 so depressed
 i have barely been able to keep my eyes open
 and the last two days i have cried every ten minutes
 i even cried as i fell asleep last night
i got my laundry done
 i even went outside while waiting for it to finish
 soaking up the sunshine and i laughed at how pale my skin is after this winter and my anxiety keeping me inside
everything just felt normal and okay
 and i feel like i can get things done
 i can concentrate
 why
 and why now
 i thought today would be a bad day
 my therapist told me something a bit harsh and it's rocked my world
i am not supposed to be okay today
 what the heck
my mom is a single parent and i've only been back with her for the past 6 yrs
 i'm  20 now and due to rumors about me at my previous college i had to take a semester off and have really cut communication with everyone because of my worsening anxiety and trust
 the past month has honestly been hell for me and i've relapsed with self harm multiple times
 i just want to get everything off my chest since i can't open up to my family or friends
i've found out my great aunts don't like me because i'm not fully black and don't even "act" black
 my mom and siblings don't know about this
 but they do know that i do have problems with anxiety and being categorized as anything
 i cried for a couple of days after hearing that
 and relapsed
 i even got scolded for not overcoming my anxiety from my mom
 who is very outgoing and friends with everyone
 she also got mad at me for not knowing how to drive
 fill out official papers
 eating 3 meals a day
 cook or clean and for not having a boyfriend or even looking for one
having someone that close to me  pick at my flaws really has made me feel even more naked and exposed to everything and everyone
 it's bad enough to deal with these demons on my own
 but she's made me feel more lost than usual and i have only here to turn to for advice
 suicide is never an option for me since i have my baby niece and sister who look up to me
 but i do want the pain and emptiness to disappear
 i want to actually smile again and mean it
day 1:
i meant to start this sooner but i just didnÛªt make time for it
 i donÛªt know if itÛªs just that i am lazy
 or just didnÛªt want to get this on paper (or whatever you call putting it on a website/forum)
 iÛªm not really sure how to start this so i guess i should explain what this is and why i am doing it
this is my journey to find help
 through any means possible
 i know there is a diary section on this forum but i wanted people who felt the need to give feedback to be able to do so
 i feel very lost in my life and i know i have several demons to slay and i am hoping maybe someone(s) can help me find my way again or just tell me if i am going the right way
  this whole thing seems very self-absorbed to me
 but i am willing to try anything at this point
i made a list of 10 things i want to change to make my life better
 and i hope if i write in this every day i will hold myself accountable
  so hereÛªs the list:
  i would like to get down to around 222 lbs
 currently i am under 340Û_i think
 iÛªm not at home but i will weigh myself and update it
 for what itÛªs worth i am 6Ûª 3Û and 32 years old
  i have (what i consider) a fairly nice apartment
  i havenÛªt really bought anything for it in the 13 months i have been here
 i just signed a lease to stay through july 2017
 so maybe try my hand at interior decorating
  i would like to start playing video games again
 i love video games
 but with my depression i just donÛªt seem to have the time to just ÛÏtrophy huntÛ like i used to
 i would like to start again
  i would like to work on my poker game
  i play poker a lot and sometimes i just make really bad decisions
 this would be known as ÛÏtiltingÛ
 i would like to work on maintaining good discipline
  i would like to curb myÛ_other gambling habits
  i tend to go a bit overboard in playing other games that mathematically i know i canÛªt win at
  i would like to keep myself in good money making situations
 although i wouldnÛªt be opposed to the occasional table game when on vacation or something
  iÛªd like to start saving money
  i have several things i do where i can make some ÛÏfound moneyÛ
 i usually piss through it
 i would like to start saving it for something
 i donÛªt know what
  i would like to repair old relationships
  this probably isnÛªt realistic with some that have ended and no other communication will be entertained
 however there are some relationships i have ÛÏaccessÛ to that feel like they are fading fast
  i would like to find the courage to meet people
  i have lived in pittsburgh for 8 years now
 it has 305
841 people
  i have yet to have a friendship out here
 i donÛªt go out (except to the casino
 obviously)
 i donÛªt like bars
 or clubs
 pretty much any and all social situations scare the hell out of me
 so i would like to maybe try to fix that
  i would like to meet someone special
  iÛªm not anything amazing
 most days i wouldnÛªt even call myself a ÛÏgood personÛ
  iÛªm a lot to handle
 and am not very fun with being constantly depressed
  i have limited interests and donÛªt like large social gatherings; resulting in people having to choose me over their friends
 it seems impossible to me but i am holding out a minimal amount of hope that someone could actually love me
  failing 8 and 9
 i would like to learn to accept being unwanted and unloved
 again iÛªm realistic
 i wouldnÛªt date/befriend/touch me so i donÛªt expect anyone else to either
  i would like to make peace with the fact that with everything against me there is a very good chance i will die alone and forgotten
so thatÛªs the list
my goal is to spend an hour writing every day for this
  obviously i donÛªt expect anyone to read every entry since iÛªm sure on days when there is a lot on my mind
 these could get to become novels
well i have 15 minutes so i guess i can talk about the battle plan for the day
i have $10 in free play at the casino so i plan to go down there and run through it and whatever i have the end cash out
 probably wonÛªt be much but i like to play the $1
25 video poker
  well i donÛªt like it
 itÛªs just a better game than slots as far as payout over time is concerned
  itÛªs a free shot at money so with no risk its positive expectation
  this free play is one of the things i would like to start saving
 i canÛªt really at the moment because i am broke until next my next paycheck (shocking
 i know)
i work overnights so i will probably head home to sleep right after the free play
 possibly pick up a breakfast sandwich or something on the way home
 i sleep a lot
 i should probably add stop sleeping 10-12 hours a day to the list
 i need to be up at 9:15-9:30 to get to work on time
 so a normal person might go to sleep around noon
 iÛªll be in bed by 10am
 earlier if i go straight home
okay
 well time to go
 anything anyone would like to know
 i will try to respond to in the next entry
so lately especially i've been taking extreme and quite sudden turns for the worst
 lasting even just a day
 and then the next day i'll be totally fine and positive
 i've never been to see a professional about the way i behave
 but i'm starting to believe there must be an explanation for the way i am feeling and why my emotions are becoming more and more intense and diverse
so i was walking home the other morning with my boyfriend at 7 ish in the morning in osaka
 we had been out drinking together the night before
 he started playing a game like being silly and hiding behind signs and stuff and then running past me
 so i joined in and wedged myself in a little tight spot between buildings
 and he ran past
 and i know it was a joke but he ran away so fast and so far when i looked he was no where in sight
and that crushed me for some reason which is ridiculous
 so i just stood there like a maniac hoping he would come back but he didn't
 he'd probably already reached home at this point
 and all of a sudden it felt like a huge hole punched in my gut and i i started sobbing and felt really really bad
 and i just kept sobbing and it wouldn't stop
 and then he came back after about 15 minutes obviously worried and was so confused what was wrong
 he talked me into coming home but i refused so many times because i just felt like saying goodbye to everything right then and there
and then the next morning i woke up in a normal mood again
 and now i woke up at 4 in the morning feeling numb
 and my emotions are just like a yoyo and i can't control it
 and it's making me so confused and tired but all i know is the times when i feel down are getting significantly for frequent and intense and it's scaring me
rant over~
i was out shopping today and happened to glance into a full length mirror
 my legs looked massive
 my tummy was sagging down
 i wanted to run out of there and cry but i said no i am going to stay and do what i have to do reminding myself that my weight is not permanent
 disgusted with my body i was
 i'm going to go and weigh myself now for the first time in a while   brb
oh my goodness i was not expecting that
 22 stone 0 lbs
 i'm trying so hard to lose weight
  i know it takes time and know what to do and avoid
 i'm just ashamed that i let myself go like this
 i feel disgusting
 does anyone have any nice tips for me
  i'm joining slimming world tomorrow
 here's to a fresh start
i just need to vent about this
i have a scoliosis and only got the diagnosis a couple of years ago (because no doctor was allowed to examine me when i was a kid and a young teen
) and that means it is untreated
 which is hard to live with
 i have chronic pain
 and if i am too active it hurts more and sometimes it locks nerves
 sometimes in my leg and sometimes all the way to my toes
 it has affected my bladder function
 and because of my balance i haven't walked right for most of my year
 my hip hurts too
i have to plan my activities every day
 if someone is coming to visit and i have to give my tiny flat a good clean that takes a week
 monday i can vacuum
 tuesday i can clean the loo
 wednesday i can clean the toilet
 etc
 etc
 i live with dishes cluttering my tiny kitchen that has no space already because washing the dishes hurts me especially
i am on pain relief
 i take pills every 5 hours
 it's supposed to be every 6 hours
 but the last hour can get so painful i only let 5 pass
when my pains got really bad a couple of years ago i didn't want to get on pain relief
 i had been addicted to paracetamol as a teenager
 and since then i didn't even take aspirin for bad period cramps
 and for months all i could do was lie in bed and sob
 i lived off of toast i'd crawl to the kitchen to get
 and sometimes i'd take a few more slices so i had for the next meal next to my bed as well
 nothing helped
 i tried to stretch but it all only seemed to make me worse
i saw a doctor
 got a special x-ray done
 was told 'its scoliosis
 eat pills
 go home'
 and the doctor added that it wasn't supposed to hurt
 but he didn't do more
 just that
 "it shouldn't hurt
 so yeah"
 i asked him if i could get a scan
 i know a few things about anatomy and i was thinking i had a slipping disc or one being squeezed by my twisting spine
 he just laughed at me
 i kept getting more and more pills
 and no scans
a long while after i tried physiopilates because someone online had said that it helped with her scoliosis pain
 that made me worse
 i could barely walk for 2 days after a session
 but the instructor was a physiotherapist and she assessed me one day when i showed up at the class in bad pains
 she told me i did indeed have a slipping disc in my spine
but yeah
 my doctors doesn't seem to worry about that
 they don't think that happens to a 26 year old
 so why waste a scan on me
i am just so sick of having pains and essentially being handicapped
 i wish i could exercise to help me lose weight
 since all my eating disorders make it difficult to lose weight that way (and lets face it
 being big doesn't help the pain
 but the fact is i'd still hurt if i was skinny)
 but i'm not allowed to anything more than walking
 and even that hurts
being young and living with this pain
 and not being able to do normal things like taking the stairs
 and dealing with people looking weird at me when i take elevators just because i don't look sick
 and also
 my best friend is so careful with me
 she means well when she says things like "can you handle that
" or do stuff for me
 and if i wince in pain or stretch she gets worried
 and my boyfriend too
 when we talk on the webcam i have to get up and stretch a lot
 and he always worries
well
 months ago i saw my doctor again
 truth be told i was wondering if i could get on disability benefits
 since
 well how can i hold a full time job in this condition
 turns out the only way you can get that is having a mental illness
 and on the paper my mental condition is not bad enough either
 you have to fit a certain list of diagnoses for that
my doctor referred me to a center that was supposed to have some group sessions for people with chronic pains who needed to learn how to deal with it and settle with that life
 i was actually looking forward to it
 the only person i know with this was my mother
 who took her frustrations out on my soul and body
 and i never want to turn into her
i visited and had a meeting with a young woman there over a month ago
 she had a whole questionnaire and went through it with me
 they also talked about other conditions etc and i told her i had un-diagnosed ptsd which also kept me inside a lot
 it was a horrible meeting and i left it shivering and almost cried on the street going home
 she kept asking and tried to dig into what had caused my ptsd
 and in the end she decided instead of the chronic pain curse she wanted me to join an anxiety group
 with an instructor who was not an actual psychologist or therapist
i decided i didn't want to do that
 i am currently in therapy with a therapist i trust and i am waiting on dbt to start
 i worry about contradicting advice and to be honest
 my issues aren't fit for someone who isn't a professional
a lady from that place finally called me today
 first of all she left me a message and told me to come for an appointment on wednesday
 at the same time as i have my next appointment with my therapist
 no way i am canceling that
 and the thing was supposed to start on thursday
i called her back and told her (what i already told the other woman) that i am being treated as an outpatient under the healthcare already
 and was waiting on dbt
 and i wasn't sure it was a good time to be mixing all that into it as well
 she reluctantly agreed with me
 but kept telling me i was always welcome to get back in touch
 and i should look at the psych clinic for their brochure and see if it was something for me after all
maybe it's a possibility when my treatment at the psych clinic ends
 so far it's set to a 20 week thing
 though i already think i might need much more than that
but that was never why i was referred there
 i came for my back
 damn it
anyway
 i'll crawl to the kitchen and get myself some lunch and my pain relief
 my daily routine
 *sigh*
i just feel like what's the point in even trying to be happy
 i'm never truly going to be happy
 everything i do turns to shit in my hands
 i look for advice
 i get slapped in the face
 i find a solution
 i hit a fucking wall
 i don't wanna kill myself anymore because what's the point
 that won't make me happy
 i don't wanna harm myself because that's just gonna hurt more
 fuck that
 i guess i'll be a scrooge my whole life
 i'll just be a cynical
 bitter
 cold
 arrogant fuck who's never happy
 that's my lot in life and my destiny
 i accept it now
restless night of thunderstorms and rain
 woke up to a grey cloudy day a reflection of how i feel
 wish i could feel optimistic but the depression is so heavy on my body and mind
 it's amazing how thoughts and feeling so totally control everything in our lives
 wish these feelings and thoughts would end
 i hope everyone finds something to keep them going today
 thank you for this site and the people on here who understand
 at least we don't have to be alone
brian
i've spent all week trying new methods of getting a new pc because this laptop is fucking horrible and does nothing but give me grief
 but nope
 nothing works
 i'm apparently just not allowed to have anything that makes me happy
 and by then i will have just killed myself
 and on top of it i'm losing one of my best friends
 fuck my life
 i'm done
 i'm just going to lay in bed day and night until i waste away
 or until my parents kick me out then i'll go waste away on the street
 i can't handle life
 i wasn't built to handle life
i just put my best friend to sleep not even 12 hours has passed
 she was the sole reason i still existed
 i am feeling so awful it was not me too
 she was in too much pain that i could not justify keeping her in this world any longer
 she was happy but so uncomfortable
  been trying to go through with the day keeping myself busy but sleeping wasn't possible when thinking of her not breathing or being warm next to me anymore
 that void
 that snore
 just seeing myself shutting down and getting away from people already and take down that fence in my mind that has built in to keep things running smoothly and voices at bay
 now have no reason in the world to care
 have nothing to lose
i am not sure if this is the right place to go but i am struggle and confused and wanted to ask for so help
 my boyfriend of 3
5 year tried to commit suicide this past month
 he came home and everything was different
 i have tried being there for him but i don't know how
 he recently told me that he wasn't sure if he want to be with me
 he said he is in a weird place and is confused
 i don't know what to do
 he says he loves me but it seems like all he can do is focus on the negitive things about our relationship
 he shows lots of anger to me
 it has been so hard not knowing what to do or say to him
 our relationship has had problem but most of the time we are happy until his depression came
 i just feel so lost
 i don't know if i should leave or stay
 we are living together and have been for 2 years
 i am so afraid of losing him
after all this time
 i think they were right about "good guys finish last"
in this day and age
 apparently it looks like the ones with the good lucks or those who steal/cheat/wrong other people are the ones who succeed in life
 while the responsible
 respectful
 good guys sink to the bottom of an abyss and are left to die
i feel so much regret
the love of my life
i've told many people the story that my fiancee lied to me and dumped me
that's not the full truth
 she did lie and she did dump me
but i did kind of flip my shit on her
 i demanded explanations
 i demanded reasons
 she didn't give me any until i broke her down enough to make her say something
by the time i realized i was in the wrong and tried to make amends
 it was too late
she was done with me
i just feel so awful
i loved her
i still love her
 i wanna go back in time and scream at my past self for what i did
 to stop it
 why
 why was i such an idiot
 why was i such a piece of shit
 this regret has flowed through me like poison
slowly killing me from the inside
 i felt the need to confess
one of the last words she said to me while we were still a couple was "why did you have to ruin a perfectly good thing
why did i ruin a perfectly good thing
and now i am alone
cold
miserable
a fitting punishment for a man like me
3 months ago i was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol a second time
  the first time i thought i was just being stupid
 the second time i blacked out
  facing minimum 90 days in jail (likely 6 months)
 18 month license suspension
  right now i have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet on my ankle and be on a curfew
  ever since this happened i have been really depressed and i feel like i have lost everything
  i'm not sure that aa works
today i saw my horse
 she's an american bashkir curly horse
 and yes she actually has a curly coat
 i bet you never heard of a poodle-horse before
 haha
 but in the spring she loses most of her curls
carly's basically a mustang
 the breed of horse that still runs in a few wild herds in the united states
 carly is short and stocky
 with a neat color of red with white flecks (this is called a roan coat- they also come in blue [really gray])
 carly also has a lot of opinions about a lot of things
i gave carly her grain and some grass pellets
 and brushed her a lot with the shedding comb
 when i am with my horse
 my head gets so quiet
 my ptsd symptoms literally disappear
 for the time i am with her
 i don't even mind spending over an hour combing every burr out of her mane and tail
carly is the biggest slow-poke of a horse you ever saw
 when i ride her
 she stops a lot
 or refuses to go in a straight line
 or both
 she's not used to being ridden much
 and even before i got her she didn't get saddled up very often for many years
 and she likes it that way
 carly will go on a trail ride if i make her
 but really prefers being petted while eating a bucket of grain
 what a life
i worry a whole lot about possible upcoming emergency vet bills
 as i am homeless and really
 really struggling financially
 but carly helps to keep me going
 so i would never give her up
 we mean a lot to each other
  it's sent now so no going back
 but i'm waiting for a reply and i am just imagining all of their emotions as they read it
 how betrayed they must feel
 how powerless and how unloved
 i feel so wretched about it
 i don't know if i've done the right thing by telling them
recently
 i was kicked out of my home and i've been living with my friend since
 i know he finds me attractive
 but he's fully aware that i'm gay and not into men
 but he just keeps making passes at me
 saying that he's up for it if i ever want to have sex
 he's also mentioned his foot fetish and how he wants pictures of my feet for the express reason of masturbation
 there's been times i wake up and pretend to still be asleep because i can feel him move my blanket trying to take pictures of them
i can't say anything
 he's my only friend and honestly
 i have nowhere else to go
i'm stressed
 depressed and suicidal
 i feel like i should've just killed myself before i was kicked out
i've been having an extremely tough time lately
 and reading through these forums have helped alleviate some of my feelings of isolation
 so id like to thank you all for that
i think it is so strange how we are all able to tell others just how much they are worth to the world
 but yet it is so difficult for us to feel the same way about ourselves
 if only we knew how to internalize our positive beliefs and apply them to our own lives
 maybe we could help our own selves
 depression truly is an ugly ugly thing that prevents us from seeing how worthy we are of happiness
i know most of what i'm thinking is irrational but it dosnt mean i can stop the thoughts no matter how much i tell myself that it still dosnt stop it
i know i have looked after this girl quiet a few times without her mum or dad around
 but now it feel so different and more responsibility as before they were mostly out for fun not because both parents were working
i will be picking her up from school everyday so i'll be the ione who communicates with her teachers
30/11 during the week night but later friday's as he is a chef
i am panicked if somthing happens to her daughter as i don't have my licence so i dont drive or even have a car so in an emergency i can't really get anywhere fast
 her partner is at least a 20min train ride away plus walking to and from his work or to the house
  i'm panicked i wont be good enough to look after her i'm panicked somthing will go wrong that she will get hurt and it will be my falut
or she won't listen to me about somthing
 i'm scared to be firm with her and don't know how to do it properly(with her) she is not a difficult child at all she is quiet good but i'm just scared
 what if she starts to miss her mum and i can't calm her down
she misses her dad when he's at work she always has but she has not been away from her mum this long before
 this week will be the first week so i don't expect her to miss her to much just yet
 i just panic she will get upset or hurt and i won't be able to comfort her or calm her
i can't even get out all that's going through my head its just going so fast right now
i'll just shut up now as i could go on and on
i finally talked to my spouse yesterday
 talking to him even about small things is extremely difficult because he has held a pattern
 many in fact that has proven to me that talking is ineffective but its what i'm supposed to do right
 he doesn't like touch
 giving it or receiving it from me
 yes me specifically
 he's very affectionate with the children
 plays with them constantly
 hugs them ect
 but doesn't do that with me at all
 two days ago i guess i crossed a line trying to hug him
 wanting to be touched
 i like listening to his heart beat and i feel safer in his arms
 he pushed me away and stated as he likes to that he's not going anywhere
 well i fucking know that
 very short conversation there that ended in me stating that he doesn't like to be touched and he said "sorry"
 so i very carefully laid out my words yesterday that it bothers me
 it bothers me also that any choice or opinion i have that doesn't match his will continue in the same question over and over until i agree
 these are life decisions not daily shit
 i told him that not wanting to touch me or wanting me to touch him is painful
 there is no rejection quite that that
 i said i've already given up so much
 none of what i said was hateful
 i didn't raise my voice
 shit i didn't even cry which is a first
 and what was i met by
 silence all night
 this is why it doesn't pay to talk
 on the other hand my stomach didn't kill me last night so i guess it helped a little bit
just "whatever" right now
 was trying to get stuff accomplished today and not going well at all
 just drained emotionally and physically
  i'm just "whatever" i had enough
 just going to try to rest
 if possible and focus on laundry
  cleaning isn't going well and my kids don't care
 my husband can handle it when he gets home
 not something i want because i would like for him to relax and rest after he's worked all day
 i'm just beyond frustrated
 hopefully my husband can help me talk to the kids correctly
  i'm drained
so i told my mom that i had been feeling anxious this past year and had talked to a doctor
  then i told her that i went to a school counsellor and that memories started coming back
  i told her that i think a man touched me when i was like maybe 3-4
so what does she tell me
 well all students get anxious about stuff
  it's part of university and choosing to be away from home
  she also told me that counsellors can sort of put false memories into people's brains
  like that people have been wrongly accused of child abuse
  she also told me that she would have never left me alone so this can't have happened
so what does she tell me to do
 well talk to people
 hang out with friends
of course i didn't tell her that well she verbally abused me for years and that some of the memories were of her
  she also doesn't know that i sh or have suicidal thoughts
the irony of  all this is that we lost a family friend to suicide a few years ago
 so you'd think she'd be more open to this
i'm like okay i'll try to hang out will more people and remember that school is stressful and that all students get anxious
she does so not get it and i don't really know how to make her understand
i haven't been on this site in a while now
 it's changed a lot
 i honestly don't even know why i'm on this site
 since my last posts i've gotten better in some aspects
 i lost 65 pounds
 and i'm know a healthy 215 lbs
 but my mental health has in all honesty worsened
 i've gotten to the point where i don't cry anymore
 i don't feel sorry for myself either
 i know nothing that happened to me is my fault
 but i've accepted it happened
 i don't really grieve anymore
 i sometimes get angry
 i sometimes get sad
 but for the most part i'm emotionally dead
 i still can't talk to people
 i'm basically incapable of maintaining a conversation
 i basically sit in the background watching everyone else progress
 i still don't take chances
 still get picked on from time to time
 although it's much worse than before i just don't care at all anymore
 you always here people say i don't care what people say when really they do and hide it but i really don't and honestly i know it's a bad thing
 i have no motivation
 i see no future for myself
 but yes i know i must trudge on because things will get better
 at least that's what they say
 i honestly know i will never physically harm myself i just don't see a point of hurting yourself while hurting
 if i even hurt anymore
 no one knows about the real me
 no one really asks either
 no one shows interest in me but i've gotten used to it
 nowadays i wake up go to school then go sit at the marina and stare at the ocean there's nothing poetic about it i just get bored
 still haven't touched drugs
 don't plan on it either
 at this point i'm waiting to see to see something good happen to me for once
 i know i shouldn't wait for success i should make it happen
 but everywhere i go failure is my outcome
 lonliness
 and social anxiety but i hope in time things will get better
figured i'd just let you all know i'm alive still
 not that any of you probably care
 i've been a burden
 a pain in the ass to everyone here and i admit it
 so i try to stay off of here as much as possible now
 i just bury myself in my video games
 livestreams and youtube videos
 at least for a few hours a day i can take my mind off of the bitter hatred i feel towards everyone and the horrible thoughts that fill my mind
but meh
 i'm rambling
 i'm alive
 don't really plan on doing anything anytime soon
i don't know why i do it
 i spend hours watching conspiracy theories and false flag videos
 i'm obsessed with watching tragic and depressing videos
 it scares the shit out of me and causes me to not want to leave my house sometime
 well a lot of times
 but my curiosity is never satisfied
 ive mentioned it to my therapist
 but she's like so
 like there is nothing wrong with it
 it doesn't seem like a big deal
 but it is
 there are times i don't want to hang out with friends or family just to get a"fix" i'm at a loss
 i feel terrible of myself
 i love debate and hearing peoples different perspectives
 but
i genuinely feel like there is something wrong
 i have tried to get help
 i was seeing a counselor
 and that helped
 but i had to stop for financial reasons
 i am trying to avoid medications
 i was on some for a little while
 but they either stopped working
 or weren't strong enough
 because i began to not care whether i took them or not
 i just never got them refilled
 i feel alright most of the time
 i am happy
 i feel that i have worth and value
 other times
 there is such an overwhelming sense of hopelessness
 i can not even get out of bed
 i used to think of suicide only a couple times a month
 and never any concrete plan or course of action
 only what it would be like
 lately fantasize about killing my self on an almost daily basis
 with detailed ways in which i would do it
 i have yet to do what i would call a serious attempt
 but i <mod edit - methods> i stopped only because i fear the pain
 i do not fear death
 i fear the pain that it will take to reach it
 my anxiety has been severe of late
 and i have been having paranoia
 my doctor says i have generalized anxiety
 but i feel like i am crazy
 i get paranoid about crazy things
 i fear that others can hear what i am thinking
 or that the pizza man will try to come in my house and rape me
 the only time i feel better is when i reach a state of numbness
 where i feel nothing at all
 i feel no fear
 no sadness
 no love
 no joy
 these are the times when i feel i am ready to do it
 i feel i could <mod edit - methods> and i am no longer afraid
 in reality
 i dont want to die
 i just dont want to feel this way anymore
i can't remember things anymore
 things are so bad at work i forget what i've done a few seconds after i've done it
 i'm losing my mind 
 going crazy
 i know they see it
 i'm stuck so stuck
so i need advice on how to be assertive with my needs
i'll try and explain the best i can
 my friend has a job now and don't get me wrong i am so glad that she does
but she does a mix of night shifts and morning shifts
 her partner works quiet late as well but always has
 so i babysit when they are both at work
before i started i said i could do a max of 3 night's a week
 she said that was fine and wouldn't expect me to do it that often
 but she didn't listen to my requests
i am scared enough of this friendship ending as it is my only friendship i have in my life
i want to help my friend out because i am that kind of person
 i will go to great lengths to help my friend(s if i had more)
i don't know how to say what i need amongst all this as i know they need the money desperately and as i said i am glad to help
but i think every on has their limits i'm sure and i can't help but feel i'm being taken advantage of a bit
 not totally but enough
 they are paying me minimal amounts and i'm not doing it for the money it's just a bonus for me
but my friend said she is going to take every shift possible and thay could mean her being away for a week or two at a time
 i have my fingers crossed that doesn't happen
i find it hard enough to say what i need and want as it is
 and it took me about two week to build up the courage and say i could only do a max of 3 night's a week
so how do you go about being more assertive so that what you say is actually heard and taken seriously
i am always scared of saying what i need or thing for fears that nobody will like me
don't get me wrong the child is amazing and i enjoy her company and playing with her
i use to think this friendship was a two way street but even before she started work things were starting to feel like i one way street
i know it all my fault for letting myself get walked all over and not being able to say no
 but i just don't know how to state my needs again it was hard enough the first time
i just wish i knew what to do to stay safe
 the more i care
 the more i get hurt
 if i could take a pill to rid myself of all emotions
 i would likely do it
 i don't care if living like a robot would be worse
 i don't care that emotions are what makes us human
 all that ever does is hurt me deeply
 i am tired of being lied to
 manipulated
 called down
 and treated like crap ever since i was a little kid
 i'm just sick of it all
 i want to numb myself and shut down and hide forever
so i reported my counsellor to his supervisor because he made me feel like i was deserving and responsible for the verbal child abuse that i told him about
  i talked with his supervisor today
  she told me that she will talk with him and he will send me an email apologizing
  that's all
like wtf
 he put what i like to call a deadly idea into my head
  i want the supervisor to talk to and educate all the counsellors
 but no she will talk to him
  and maybe put up a sign telling students how to complain
social anxiety and depression are destroying me
 i also don't trust the so-called professionals and am also skeptical of how effective the medicine really is
 which was made worse after a friend killed himself around 1 month ago
 after being depressed and in treatment for over 10 years
 my family has also expressed an intolerance and disrespect for people with social anxiety before (not just with that
 either
 they're really close-minded in general) so i can't even get myself to tell them i have it
 or that i've dropped out of college because of it
 i've been just pretending to go
 but i actually gave up on it around 8 months ago
 i just can't take it
 this is my second attempt at college
 in the first one i dropped out after only 2 months
 i only have friends online
 have very few very limited interests or things i somewhat enjoy
 and i thought i was doing a good job on at least keeping the suicidal feelings away but now they're back
 had them for several years
 last year was the peak
 and in january and february i was mostly not thinking about it anymore even though i was still feeling terrible
 now i feel so worthless
 hopeless
 stuck and alone that they're suddenly coming back full force and i just wish i would have ended everything last year as planned
 i don't see a way out of this hell
 i've been thinking so much about telling my family i need help
 but even assuming that they'd be willing to help
 there's nothing they can even do to help anyway
 so what's the point
 it started a few weeks ago with the flu that developed into sinusitis and tonsillitis and i ended up on antibiotics and steroids
 i've since had another flare up of tonsillitis which did resolve itself
 but i am left now feeling achey and tired all the time
 it physically hurts to lift my arms to do anything like write or type and i'm really struggling with the physical stuff at work because i have no strength and feel so tired
 right now my mouth is full of sores which are very painful
 i have one behind my back molars and it is mimicking infected wisdom tooth pain (definitely not a tooth cutting through) and the entire right side of my face hurts and aches
 it's in my ear and my other teeth hurt
 i have another sore under my tongue and another on the inside of my lip
 i'm feeling very sorry for myself tonight and feel like i want to cry
went to the hospital for pain my back
 i knew what it was before they told me
 blood clots in the lung
 this is the 3rd time
 they didn't keep me this time
 they sent me home with shots to give myself
 i've been on blood thinners since the last time 2010
 but i kept forgetting to do refill
  then it needed to approved for more refills so that took 2 more days
 so i was off of them for 6 days
 geez
 i won't ever do that again
tired of waking up with the darkness of depression
 tired of anxiety and not being comfortable in my body
tired of feeling lost and alone
 tired of looking for answers that lead to disappointment
 tired of myself for being so weak
 i know it takes work to get well
 maybe i'm just too lazy
 i don't know
 i just turned 64 and wish it were over
 i don't want to die really
 i want to stay and look after my dog
 i know there is beauty in the world and good people
 but i'm just tired of the darkness that seems to surround me
 i know it'll pass
 but right now
in the midst of the feelings
it feels like an eternity
brian
i want to get off the ride now
i'm beyond exhausted
but yet i still ride this horrible ride
 but for how long
i can't even let it out i'm over repeating myself
i just can't
 i can't
 can't can't
 i cant
so my dad rang me today i screened the call
 i know i shouldn't be a horrible daughter but i can't help it
 let's just say he did things that no man should do anyone  let alone to a child
but he just sent me a text
 saying he wants to visit and the end of the month (he lives over the other side of australia) he has visited me once here and i did not let him come or see my home i meet him out at public places
i only seen him two days and not even  whole days but now i cant visit those places without thinking of him
 i already get set off by things that remind me of him and i don't want anymore
so i need to figgure out a plan as to why i won't be able to have this vist or why i'll be busy
 the thing is i won't be busy i had to stop uni until next semester so i can't use i'll be busy with that
 i don't work so that's out
 i can't say i'm on a holiday i have no money and i don't even drive to say i'm on a local get away
so i need ideas as to why i can't do this and i can't think of any so if anybody has some ideas  please share them with me
sorry in advance
another day
suns out
 easter weekend and families are getting together and having fun
 here i sit alone in my darkness wondering how i became
so broken
 even my dog is depressed
 that's my fault too
 my dark feelings are palpable
 yes
 i've tried therapy
 medication
 hypnosis
 self help books
 meditation
but i'm still broken
 no idea why i'm writing this
 guess because the thread said "let it all out" so i'm trying
i read the stories of others on here
 going through terrible things
 much worse than mine
 i just wonder why it's like this
 don't know anymore
 morning always seems to be the worst
 probably the prospect of another dark empty day
brian
some of you know i am having a really hard time feeling like facebook friends don't care about me at all
 and i am mourning the loss of some formerly important friendships i once had
  i spent a little time here in san francisco yesterday with two friends back to visit california
 after they moved to north carolina about 3 years ago
i still have a lot to say about this upsetting experience
 which i will write about later in my diary by candlight
  but i need to start this thread to laugh a little
  because i really need to laugh about this
when my friends/ former friends picked me up in the car
 within a few moments we were driving down a steep san francisco hill and my friend
 naturally
 took out her phone to get a pic of the road
  we didn't spend a lot of time together
 which was both a relief and very hard and sad
  but in that time
 she managed to get pics of almost everywhere we went
 from the mechanical museum (mini arcade) to a small beach cove area
  we didn't spend a lot of time talking
  it was very awkward
  but she sure took pictures
  various selfies and snapshots of "cool stuff"
it's like
 why are photos so important
  what about the actual experiences you have in life
  there is a joke online when someone describes something incredible
 and people respond with "pic or it didn't happen
"  i think some people take that to heart
  it's like they don't feel they exist fully if they aren't documenting every moment
which leads me to my other former/ lost friend
 a person i first brought out to the barn to help me with my horse
  we used to hang out together
 i've gone to her place a few times and we usually got starbucks before the barn
  it was nice
  then we drifted apart pretty fast
 and while i understand what i think the reason was
 it still hurt a lot
  it still hurts even now
so this person got her own horse
 and she did a very good job training it
  it was truly impressive
 and it makes sense she wanted to show off a little online
  this person has not just facebook going
 but instagram
 snapchat and i imagine a few other sites she regularly uses
  she gets a lot of likes for her many pictures
 always beautiful and perfectly filtered
  but now i can kind of laugh about how hard she must be trying
  i'm not laughing *at* her
 just at the absurdity of taking so many pics of things that you are more concerned with setting up a great shot than actually just living life
i think a lot of people kind of chuckle when they see concert footage and there are a million people watching the concert they were lucky to get seats at
 entirely through the screens of their cell phones
  a tiny screen is absolutely not the same as sitting back and enjoying a great concert
  who cares if you want everyone to see the fun time you had
  why don't you actually try to have a good time and make memories
  not pictures to prove that you were there
anyway
 my former/ lost friend began practicing yoga regularly
 and she got quite good at it
  and
 as i said
 she's great with horses
  so now she posts a ton of photos of her doing yoga on her horse
  really cool stuff like scorpions
 various poses
 the horse calm underneath her and the light bouncing off the field below so beautifully
  the photos are nice
 yes
but you have to wonder:  how much are you documenting your experiences
 instead of living them
 if you make a point to show everyone that you can do yoga on a horse
i don't know if this will trigger anyone
 so i apologize in advance if it does
 when i got to my uncle's this morning
 he informed me that a friend of my cousin killed himself recently
 everyone was really shocked
 but those who knew him had expected it somewhat
 as he had tried a few times before
 i felt sad for my cousin
 because he had lost another friend through suicide several years ago
 my uncle tried looking up the story online and couldn't find anything
 that was strange
 since he had supposedly done it in a public place
 well
 my aunt sent a text saying the guy had faked it all
i just
i can't really wrap my head around this
 why would you fake your own death just to get attention
 i couldn't imagine hurting anyone like that
 i felt for him a bit
 since clearly he needs help
 but it also made me angry that he would do that
 it made me think about my own suicidal feelings even more
 one reason i haven't done it yet is because it would hurt those who care about me
 but how will they know when he is really in trouble if he cries wolf like that
 i just don't know what to think about all of this
[so i decided to make this diary because i wasn't sure where to talk about all the little things i feel and minor things that happen without spamming threads
  i don't know how often i'll write here
 but as the title says
 when i do
 i'd enjoy it if people would reply (if they'd like
)  if something big comes up or i start feeling severely suicidal
 i probably make another thread
  however
 my feelings have been rather low-key of late
i'm feeling down and kinda want to hurt myself
 but it's not anything serious
  i mean
 i made myself bleed a little not too long ago by messing with the scabs covering the places where i'd minorly injured myself a few days ago and thought about making some new ones
 but a crisis this isn't
  honestly this might be no more than boredom
 loneliness and overthinking
i just keep thinking too much
  tonight i came to the conclusion that i should not be alive
 that i was not meant to be on this earth
  i'm not sure what made me think that
 but it has stuck with me
  i texted my friend (one of the two i've been torturing with talk of suicidal thoughts recently) about it
 and he reassured me that i should be alive
  i told him i had trouble believing him
  now i feel a little guilty about the disbelief somehow
i'll probably lie here and watch netflix instead of sleeping
  like that's gonna make me feel better
i wish i'd never existed
 in retrospect my life has been a constant battle with anxiety
 depression and panic attacks
 i've spent most of the time trying to fix myself and others
 just doesn't make sense any more
 i'm tired of the constant battle and see no light at the end of the tunnel
 i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up
 i'm alone anyway and have no family except my dog
 who's been more of a friend than anyone to me
 the last person who cared about me passed away last year and it's been a downward spiral since
 even writing this looks like the epitome of self pity
 so be it
i don't know how else to feel
 if only there were a timeline on this pain
 if only i could see an end to it
 but i don't
 each day seems worse than before with the occasional short(hours) reprieve
 i'm tired of trying to act like everything is okay and wearing a mask for others to see
 i don't want to burden others with my dark feelings
 most wouldn't understand anyway
 i'm just tired and weary
im not even upset at my life at this point
 i just want relief from this constant state of exhaustion
 the thought of suicide is tempting not just end it all but to not feel so used up anymore
 im ready to have a breakdown just from fighting sleep all day long
 from having to battle to get up in the morning
 caffiene does nothing anymore
 2 pots 3 pots coffee doesnt matter
 i am still indescribily exhausted
 and after all of this to finally fall asleep just to have nightmares
 can i not escape
i've known this girl for a while now and i thought we were becoming really good friends
 she's a lesbian so didn't think much about it
 just that i liked hanging out because it got me out of this lonely rut i'm in
 she's always hanging out with this other girl and she stays over at her place a lot
 though she said they're just friends
 i got into doing some things for her
 like driving her to places she needed to go
 and going to the grocery store
 this was all happening while her other friend was studying for exams
 one night we hung out at her place and one thing led to another
 and we became intimate
 this happened the next day as well
 but after that things changed
 her other friend had finished exams
 and she stopped responding to my texts
 i send some texts frequently over the last couple of weeks
 and tried calling her a few times
 i knew she often ran out of minutes so i didn't think much of it
 this is what we've always done before
 either texted or called each other
 i went out last night to a pub for a drink
 because my birthday is on monday and i wanted a night out
 i met her and her friend in there
 they were eating
 i sat at the bar and didn't say anything else to her
 and before i knew it they had left
 i then got a text shortly afterwards that my constant texting and trying to call her was making her uncomfortable and she wanted me to leave her alone
 it wasn't any more than i normally would have done when she was talking to me
now i just feel used
 she could have just talked to me rather than ignore me for the last few weeks
 i let her know that all she does is use me while her other friend is away
 and that i hope she's happy with herself
 i've since deleted her number
 but today i feel so down i'm not sure what to think of it
 i'll be 32 tomorrow
 another year of loneliness
 hopelessness and frustration
i am seriously so fed up with myself
 i let him back in
 every
 damn
 time
 and it's always the same
 broken promises
 waiting up for him
 waiting around
 i really need to be strong and just let him go
 i just don't want to be alone
 i know he doesn't love me
 i would be a complete ass if i honestly thought he did
 i don't know who to talk to because no one knows i'm still seeing him
 my brothers would be pissed
 my mom would be heartbroken
 and i'm pretty sure my dad would be too
 i've haven't even told my sister and she knows everything
 i'm 25 years old
 why can i not get my shit together
each and every day my life has been disappearing
  my hopes
 my dreams are gone
 i see no future for what i need to do or what my purpose is or should be
 i don't even know what to do with my life
 it feels like my life is slipping away and i have no idea how to stop it
  my life seems meaningless 
my anxiety is so bad i feel reckless
 i want to go drive as fast as i can in the mountains
 drift around curves
 dodge trees
 hug the cliff's but i wouldn't dare put other people in harms way
 with all these mixed feelings and emotions
 my heart and brain are enemies
 cause my brain dosnt seem to want to help with regulating feelings and emotions
 and has a horrible way of managing thoughts
 i have to be the mediator
 i shouldnt have to mediat between emotions and my thoughts
 that get carried away
  all i do know is they both hurt they are screaming
 which is screaming louder
 what do i fix first
  my heart is going to stop and my brain is going to explode
 im walking on fire
 while grasping ice cubes tightly in my hands
i dont know why my roommate and neighbor have been angry and snapping at me lately
 i had a fight with my roomate because she snapped at me for asking her a question as to wether or not she wanted to keep a bottle that was full of liquid or if i could return it
 telling me when does she ever not drink her drinks
 i said i dont know
 when your sick or not feeling well like you have lately
 then complaining i dont talk loud enough
 i am getting so sick of being treated this way and so i foght back this time and told her maybe she needed her ears checked
 and really i think she is just seriously sleep deprived
 she keeps being out all day avoiding being home
 and complains all the time about henry being in the way
 or me annoying her
 or so and so pissing her off
my neighbor asked if i wanted to return cans with her and go can hunting
 but i only read the return part
 so i came out from that fight with my roomie to meet up with her and needed to get my service dog in training out (he had been couped up for 2 days) so i told her i would bring him
 but i didnt realize she wanted to go hunting also and didnt think i had the energy to do so
 she noticed i was off and asked what was wrong so i just told her i thought (and i did) she meant just returning them
 not looking for more
 (and avoided talking about the fight because i didnt think she needed to know nor did i care to talk about it) she told me ok
 i could go and get henry out and she would go herself with the cans
 well i messaged her later in the evening to ask how the canning went
 she told me she didnt want to talk
 texted her today and asked how she was
 no response
 asked her if she was mad at me or something and just not returning messages or what
 apparently she is
 but i still dont know what i did wrong
 she told me i was condesensing and didnt even bother to knowor ask her how she was going to do things on her own
 well
 she told me she would be fine on her own and i told her where to go so i assumed she would be fine
  i dont know how i was condesending
 and she told me she felt like i wasnt treating her like a friend like she was inconviniencing me
 and i am sure i told her i wasnt sure i could physically walk around all day
 (she is in a wheelchair) so i apologyzed but still dont understand what i did wrong
 and it is eating at me
why am i always the one at fault
 why am i the one "bothering" everyone else
 why is it never anyone elses fault
 am i really that annoying and such a burden
 just because i need to take care of my own needs too
 just because i am capable of sticking up for what i want now
 and getting sick of being put down
 or am i in the wrong
 and if i am
 what exactly did i do wrong
there are things that needs to be done
 yet i don't want to do it
i know that i will hate myself after this
 and i will get depressed again
i don't want to be depressed
 on the other hand
  i don't want to do things as well
 i want to hit my head on the table
 i don't know what's wrong with me t____t
it is like an endless battle within me
if only i can disappear
what will happen if i took 'it' away
 it won't matter to anyone
 as long as i feel okay it's amazing for me to relax forever i think suppose
i just hate the life i have and i wish i could take it away without failing
imagine after <mod edit:methods>you feel everything is going to be okay now
 you just open your eyes to that painful light in a hospital people treating you like a maniac like some psychopathic serial killer
 it feels like even in your own death you manage to fail
 what a failure you are even taking away you own fucking life
<mod edit - timeline>
my past and present are catching up with me even in my nightmares
 having no one to ever go anywhere with down to the rapists family pestering and trying to draw me out to being extremely promsicuous when younger
 i wish i could start all over
 obviously since that can't happen i just have to deal with it
 i have severe ptsd and cannot cope right now even though dbt is helping me some bit
 i feel everyone hates me although they are just thoughts i know
 i feel like a failure
 mostly because i am one
 my family are embarrassed of me and they have even said it so that is factual
i endured severe bullying in school too and even on the school bus
 it's all coming back to me  i want to find a comfy rock and hide under it
i'm just about done with everything
 i say no and people won't respect it
 i'm a fucken puppet
i just want to scream
 for the life of me
 i don't know why people think it is okay to bully me
 i "do" speak up
 i "do" say stop
 so why does this behavior continue to happen towards me
i work in academia
 for the past 4 years
 which equates to all of my years at this academic position
 i have been bullied by the known department bullies
 one was assigned to be my mentor
 the other actively recruited me for this position
  i finally gained the strength and self-confidence to interview for academic jobs elsewhere
 on friday
 i was given a tentative offer which would become final once the reference and background checks were completed
 i told my references to expect a call
 one of my references said that she would hate to lose me but understands why i need to leave
 hello
 i'm suicidal
 depressed
 and physically ill due to workplace bullying
 well this person who said that she would be my reference and wrote an excellent reference
 tells me that when she spoke with the other university
 she gave me a bad reference
 in fact
 she tells me that she went into the department's dirty laundry
 what a pos
 the dysfunction of my current department has nothing to do with my potentially new job
 if i'm not telling them
 why on earth would she
 bitch
needless to say
 i have been devastated since i spoke with my pos reference this morning
 why on earth would she feel it is okay to do this
 the reality is that i will be leaving the department after this school year
 even if i do not have a job
 and even if i have to leave in a body bag
i provided this pos reference with the reasons why i'm choosing this new opportunity
 these were all true and all positive
 she had no reason to add her unwarranted 2 cents
i hate her
 what a pos
 people in the department do not like her and i have been sticking up for her
 no more
ever since birth
 i remember being friendless
 i had people i could speak to
 that i classified as "friends"
 but never anyone my age that i could actually trust
i'll admit
 i don't help myself much
 i barely ever go out
 i avoid speaking to alot of people
 and when i do
 i seem to naturally put them in the most awkward positions ever
that's why i developed voices
 why i began to speak to inanimate objects
 i just feel
 so completely devoid of companionship
 and whenever i try to gain it
 i always end up with just another "friend"
i'll admit it
 i'm a manipulative bastard
 i test people that i know
 and after testing every single one of the people that i had any social connection to
 every single one of them did the exact same thing
i told them fabricated stories
 then told them that i can't have anyone else knowing
 they were all coherent
 just in case two people came in contact
so i made 40 fake facebook accounts
 and i spoke to every single one trying to get this "information" out of them
every single one blabbed
 some to more than one person
 they didn't question it
 they just told me what i had said
 threw in some extra stuff
 and then i had a very in-depth conversation with each one about how "****ing weird" matthew is
pffft
 i don't need friends though
 i have
errrr
my shovel
you guys
one the other side of the world
that i barely know
yeah
 my life is kind of disappointing
alone in this prison there is a door that never opens
alone in this prison i peer
 i hear
 i imagine things beyonds these walls
my life has been grasping for courage for hope for fortune
  i would be very grateful for the dimmest shade of light
i have to deduce that i'm just not a good person
  i'm not enough
  i'm not special in any way
 to any one
 there's little chance i ever will be
i'm self deprecating
  i've withered into nothing
  i haven't tried in years
  it's a defense against what has come before
  what repeats
  new faces
 new places
 new romance
 always ends the same
  why would it be any different if i tried again
  how do you try again after hiding for so many years alone
 withering
 afraid
 bitter
 empty inside
 steeling that emptiness with a tight shell of self hatred
 how do i decide to live again
  i've been dead for so long
 but another venture in betrayal would rot the corpse i've become
  i couldn't endure it
 and i can't endure this
 solitude
 loneliness
 self exile any better
what is this place for
  to vent
  to articulate hopelessness and superfluity
  to attempt to mold form to the erratic and crushing and mad-flailing pings and chokes and hiccups of emotional failings
since i have no one
  speak to no one
  am loved by no one
  am valued by no one
  maybe i should attempt the pointless experiment of at least speaking out loud
crumbum has ___ days to live
i apologize in advance if this is the wrong section for this
i'm worthless
 i've accomplished nothing in my life and i haven't been happy in at least 10 years
there is no safe place
 i can't go to any of my friends and burden them with this
 i've always been the strong one
 i'm tired of being strong
 i want to let go
different ways have been going through my head all day
 some have even been displaced in favor of a more efficient approach
 i don't think i'd even leave a note
 no one would notice or care anyway
it's a struggle to do anything and i don't even see the point
 i'm broken and alone
again sorry if this is the wrong forum i just needed to get that out
today is april 18
 2016
 today marks one year i proved i was strong enough to leave an abusive relationship
 this day may not be special to anyone else
 but today i am so proud of myself
 after three years of being mentally and physically beat down
 i have officially been free of it all for an entire year today
 i am a survivor
 i may not have anyone in my life right now that knows everything that happened
 but dear god
 i have me
 i know what i did
 i know what i have overcome
yesterday i think i lost my best friend
 i could tell her anything and everything going on and so much of me wants to scream to her that i am still here today after all of this and revel in my accomplishment
 but i met her on here
 so i should be okay with the suicide threats and pictures of self injury i received
 but it just made me so sad
 i haven't been in the right frame of mind to be able to help her
 so i decided that i would rather her be mad at me than for her to not be here at all
 i messaged her mother on facebook to help her because i knew i couldn't
 when i saw her picture it triggered me so much all i wanted to do was do the same to my body
 to feel that feeling
 so i knew i wouldn't be able to stop her
 instead of understanding that i was trying to be helpful she ended up blocking me
 this is the twenty-first century and she can do as she pleases
 but have it known i did the same to her
 after i found out she blocked me i did the same for a few hours
 on everything she could possibly use to contact me
 if i was going to be exiled for helping
 i wasn't about to be a victim
today
 i have re-evaluated my maturity and unblocked everything because i know i am a survivor
 i don't need to add drama to my life anymore
 i've had quite enough drama in my life
today
 my name is kaitlin and i am surivivor
i don't know what tomorrow holds for me
 but looking at how far i have come in just a year i know i can do this
 i'm just over a week free of self harm myself and i will celebrate every single second of that
i have depression and anxiety and it sucks
 but i refuse to let it be the end of the world
today
 as i sit outside in the sunlight smoking my cigarette and drinking my coffee i began thinking just how amazing all human beings are
i am a human being too
i am amazing
you are amazing
we are all amazing
it's about time everyone realized just how incredible we all really are
i'm not expecting this newfound mindset to last forever
 but today
today
 goddamnit
 i am amazing
i am exhausted
 i know i would be after the weekend
for once i hadn't set my alarm
 and i fell asleep early last night
 i only woke up after 1pm
 and i was still tired
 i got up though and got slightly productive
 i cleaned my freezer
 took a good shower
 finally got the dishes that has piled up for days and days (they have been rinsed though)
 and i somehow thought i'd feel good about that
of course
 washing the knives i was tempted to harm myself
 and i had to use a lot of mental strength to just wash them
 wipe them and put them in the drawer
i have 'realized' i am still sick
 i have been thinking i was tired
 depressed and anxious and that was what kept me so exhausted
 the doctor who saw me at the psych er a couple of weeks ago said i probably had the flu after checking my vitals and for a few days i did try to take care of that
but i'm starting to think i still have it
 spending most days indoors and a lot of the time in bed i guess i don't notice
 it worries me though
 if i can't realize i've got flu
it does make sense  now though
 nausea
 loss of appetite
 fatigue
 getting warm
 runny nose
 headache and what i thought was food poisoning
 that's what the flu always does to me
 today i have the final proof; further loss of hearing
i am already nearly deaf on one ear
 and have a bad hearing on the other
 this is due to too many ear infections and various procedures to cure them too
 the scarring on my eardrums have messed up the pressure inside my ears
 and when i'm sick that balance gets even worse
 i'm sick
it worries me
 what else have i been ignoring
 how low can you get emotionally
and i really don't need more excuses to stay in my flat and not go outside
 i am trying to work against my anxiety here
 trying to come up with reasons to get out
 of course fresh air is good
 that's a positive one
just yeah
 i worry myself
i'm the lonley girl in the corner
nobody sees or hears
i'm the lonley girl in the corner
who cries endless silent tears
i'm the lonley girl in the corner 
who is hanging by a thread
i'm the lonely girl in the corner
that's is better of dead
i feel so isolated lonley and down
 i feel nobody could care about me at all unless i can benefit or help them its the only time people contact me
i am a pathetic waste of space
a totally useless human
so why waste precious oxegyen
i am just sick and tired of people disapproving of everything about me
 the wrong clothes
 wrong hairstyle
 the way i act and live is wrong
 the list goes on and on
 seems like family
 friends
 and acquaintances always have something to say about it
 god forbid i eat a cookie
 i might gain a pound
 well i shouldn't have another drink
 but others can get crazy drunk
 it feels like people are constantly putting down every aspect about me
 i'm really fed up with it
 do people think i am incapable to make my own decisions
 i feel like i need to kowtow to everyone's demands
 because i don't want to upset the apple cart
 i try to tell people this hurts me
 and that they should mind their own business
 but it goes in one ear and out the other
 i feel like no one takes me seriously
 if no one likes me the way i am
 sometimes i feel it is better if i don't exist at all
 this is goimg to be a weird thread maybe but i want to let it all out
i am a 22 year old woman
 my mom touches me in a weird way since i was a teenager
i used to go crazy and hit her like i am a kung fu master
 i got really angry and yelled at her always
i always said her i dont want her to touch me
today she touched my ass again and it just made me really grossed out
those arent accidental touchs
 she just touches my ass and leave her arm there
i want to beat the shit out of her when she touches me without my consent
she asks me if i am a rape victim or not just because i dont want her to touch my ass
i also feel like my mom is closeted lesbian so she kinda tries to satisfy some of her repressed urges
i wonder which part of
 "i'm visually impaired
 i'm blind
 i can't see
 my eyes don't fucking work
" people aren't understanding today
i've been having a strange issue with my new laptop
 where every few days
 my screen reader slows down to a crawl and is barely able to function
 the sound it makes when this happens is like none i've ever heard
 sort of like it's straight out of a star wars movie
 my guess is that something is bogging down the memory
 and so maybe it needs more ram; but just for the hell of it
 i called the manufacturer and tried to explain what happens
 i started the call off by explaining that i'd probably only be able to provide limited information because i'm totally blind
 but was just looking for some input on what the cause might be
 when i explained the problem
 the first question was
 "can you tell me what's on the screen when this happens
" um
 nope
 i can't
 "ok then
 please give us a call back when this happens again so you can verify for us what you see on the screen
" um
 again
 impossible
 i'll see the same thing then that i do now
 which is nothing
 "well (at this point
 he's getting desperate)
 when it happens again
 please have someone who can see describe the screen for us
" right
 the last time it happened was midnight a few days ago
 i'm sure the couple across the street wouldn't mind that wake-up call
 needless to say
 i bought an 8gb stick of ram and am hoping that fixes the problem
 if it doesn't
 i'm off to the geek squad at bestbuy
next issue
 fraudulent charges on my credit card
 that i wasn't aware of immediately because my statement comes in a format i can't read
 i called
 again explained that i'm totally blind
 and that i need some assistance in dealing with this because i'm not able to handle it the usual way
 i also explained that their website is no longer accessible with a screen reader
 so i have no way of accessing crucial account information
 first thing he asks me to do is read something to him from my account page on their site
 strike one
 next
 he'll send me a statement in the mail
 and i can circle the charges i wish to dispute and mail it back
 strike two (no reliable sighted help in the area at the moment)
 at this point
 we're both getting frustrated
 and he agrees to circle the charges for me and handle it personally
 thank you
luckily
 i don't need vision to know where the peach wine is in my cabinet
i came back again
 but not because i was feeling down again or that im thinking of killing myself or something
 rather i came back because i am actually doing good for sometime now and just wanted to reread how badly i was doing before and the feeling of doing okay now is something precious to me
 id like to clear that i am not feeling "great" im just okay and it's something im very thankful for
 it's enough for me to just be okay for some good time
 ive been clean for months now
 ive not been cutting like i used to and that now i am keeping a good balance on my life
 still trying hard but am managing
 i slowly picking the pieces of my broken self and putting my life back together
 i hope ican continue with this and i hope that others see this as well
 i hope everything turns out okay for all of us
 please dont give up
i fail to understand why my landlord thinks it's funny when he's had multiple complaints about bats getting into this apartment
 he said he doesn't know how to get rid of them
 and asked if we could do it
 what
 that's your job
 isn't it
 it was bad enough when one was flying through the kitchen one night
 it was even worse when one came through the light fixture above the shower
 but what tops it off is when i am sitting on my bed
 minding my own business
 when suddenly something hits me in the side
 i get up because i instantly know what it is
 i lock myself in the bathroom
 thinking i will be safe there
 but no
 of course not
 the damned thing crawls under the door
 i start throwing things at it
 thinking it will go out the other way
 it comes flying at me
 and i have to run out of there
 granted
 it is small and probably harmless
 but freaked me out beyond belief
 dare i say it was kind of cute
 but that's not the point
 the point is
 i am afraid that one will bite me when i am sleeping or something
i am wondering
 what happens if the landlord refuses to do anything
 who do i contact next
 i am beyond freaked
 i have that creepy crawly feeling
 i even cried and screamed a bit
 yes i am a girl  of course
 they always disappear when my grandpa tries to get them
 i'm not crazy
 another thing i am wondering
 should i go to the doctor if the thing just landed on me
 or am i likely in the clear
 i don't think i can get any disease just from close contact
 but i don't know for sure
 any input would be much appreciated
just want to get this off my chest because i feel totally alone
my blood-sugar was running high all night (i have type 1 diabetes)
 and i thought i had it covered when i gave myself more insulin before i went to bed
 i'm also sick
 but it's nothing more than fatigue
 sneezing
 runny nose
 and nasal congestion
 nothing more
 pssh
 anyway
 i didn't want to wait 2 hours for the insulin to completely take effect because fuck that
 so i went to sleep right away
 however
 i woke up a few hours later
 around 6 am
 and i was just contemplative and feeling especially suicidal
 it took me a while
 but i realized that i probably woke up because my blood-sugar was still high--it fucking was
 that in particular made me feel even more helpless
 i took more insulin
 lied down and brooded for about an hour
 and i checked my blood-sugar again
 and it was fine
 yay
 afterwards
 i tried going back to sleep
 but by then
 my suicidal thoughts and hopeless pondering had already consumed me
 i can only idle away so much time before i lose myself to suicidal ideation
 nothing happened
 i wasn't feeling impulsive--just ill-fated
 i contacted my counselor
 whom i was supposed to have an appointment with today
 and explained to her why can't make the appointment
 and she was understanding
 i wasn't going anywhere if my body and mind was simultaneously making me feel dreadful
it's odd to say
 but those two hours that i spent contemplating suicide felt ephemeral
 in my case
 i feel like depression doesn't necessarily perpetuate my life--it hastens it
i just need to let some steam out (well more than i already did while writing complaints to the relevant people)
i am unfortunate enough to have an 'invisible' handicap
 (untreated scoliosis)
 which among many other things means that stairs are my enemy
 it causes me a lot of pain and i'm so
 so scared of falling because of my screwed balance
 and the pain isn't just over once i leave the stairs
 it lasts the entire day
 adding to my chronic pain
sunday i was going home from a lovely weekend with my friend and some of her friends
 by train
 there 2 elevators were out of service
 meaning i was forced to use the stairs
 which i did
today i took a shortcut home from the store that lead me through the train station
 i figured by now they must have fixed the elevator
 i mean
 there's people in wheelchairs and people with prams who need to use them
 well
 i was being stupid
so yeah
 i staggered down the stairs
 carrying heavy groceries
 i was about to cry from pain at that point
 but i kept a brave face
i went to the kiosk
 i know they aren't officially connected to the station (they just have their shop in the station building and sell tickets
) and i told the girl there about the elevator
 she didn't seem impressed
 even if i mentioned that it was very 'inconvenient' for handicapped people
 she then spotted a man in an orange suit and told me to run after me
i'm sorry
 run
 i could barely walk
 i had hoped at least she could take a message or something
 but nope
i went home
 fuming and hurting
 opened my laptop and wrote two complaints
 one to the train company and another to the kiosk
i mean
 wtf
 for at least 4 days the elevator has been out of service
 there was no notes anywhere saying it was out of order
 so for all i know no one is fixing it
i am lucky
 despite the pain
 that i could make it down the stairs
 but a person in a wheelchair will be caught there
i am so sick of this
and also
 another thing i am sick of is the looks people give me when i go for an elevator at all
 i weigh a bit too much
 but the truth is even if i was skinny i'd still have pains (yes
 maybe a little less
 but still)
 and it's very hard to exercise with this condition
 the only exercise i'm allowed is walking
 and even that hurts
10 weeks pregnant today
  been struggling with eating without feeling so sick
  been forcing myself to eat for the baby and already i feel huge
 trying not to let the eating disorder take over for the baby's health
 already want the baby to be here but mostly to go back to restricting
  trying not to give back into behaviors but just so hard when i feel this way
 hope to get through the rest of this pregnancy okay
i haven't been on here for a few years
nothings really changed
 stopped therapy and meds as my doctors kept cancelling my appointments
 just had enough of it all
 and the people in my therapy group were really judgemental
 made me feel crappy
 one to one therapy wasn't for me
 it was just awkward
 i hate starting conversations and they always made me start
 i hate talking
 never know what to say and definitely don't know what's going on in my head
lost a few friends once again and feel others pulling away
 i just know i'm going to end up alone again
loads of people i know are getting married
 having kids
 getting their own place and i'm just stuck at home with my parents
 jobless and depressed
on a plus i lost 4stone in weight
 still a long
 way too go but my eating habits are getting under control
  occasionally pig out and end up throwing up but i'm slowly getting there
this year i've started to do things for myself instead of trying to please others
i'm finally putting inheritance money to use and going on holiday by myself (well on a group tour thing)
 ticking something off my really long bucket list
i'm paranoid as hell about it all but im doing it
 just hope i dont have any panic attacks or piss off other people with my moods
dont even know what to write
 im just desperate to keep myself occupied at the moment
 oh god i dont even know what i want to say
 i mean yeah im safe and all but its kind of wishing i wasnt
 you know
 like
 no im not in any immediate danger but i wish i was
 i want to be
 i dont want to wake up but i cant kill myself
 my mind screams for suicide but my body cant do it
 its like everytime im alone dark
 sharp smoke enters my skull and i just feel like banging my head hard against a wall to make it stop or even better just chop it off
 how do you tell this to people
 and more importantly why
 ive told people before but it didnt get better because of it
 not for long anyways
 i mean im still here alone in my bed wishing to be dead
 meds
 therapy
 you name it
 nothing works
 i always end up here
 fkn always
 but i guess thats how its supposed to be
 ive always known that this is what life is but i just cant learn to live with it
 dont want to
 its not worth it
 im sick of it all
 but im stuck and i dont know what to do
 cant go either way
 ugh
how often do you feel suicidal
  and i don't necessarily mean the extreme where you actually have a method ready
  i don't necessarily mean that extreme
 but rather just the thought that you still wish that you could "go" pretty soon
   if you reply to this post
 you could also include the frequency of times that you actually think about suicide
 whether extreme or moderate or mild
  because
 after all
 i want to cover the whole range
 that is
 from extreme to "moderate" wishes
  in my case
 even though i am past middle age already
 i generally only seldom think of actual methods
 but at least once a week fantasize how wonderful it would be if my doctor told me i have a terminal illness from which i would die within a month
   in other words
 in my case
 it's mild to moderate 99% of the time
 which means
 i guess
 that i'm within the safety zone
so while i don't actively seek out any methods
 i at least fantasize about the joy i would feel if i ever get a terminal-type diagnosis from my doctor
so how often do you feel suicidal
  and what are the ranges
i think the irony here is work lies in mental health
 so occasionally i notice my own thought behaviors are eerily reminiscent of the people i've worked with before
 the thing for me is that being well isn't not thinking about suicide
 i think about it every day to a greater or lesser degree even when i consider myself well
 it makes me think of an addict in recovery who isn't using maybe
a bad day is like today
 when its the last thing i am thinking of when i go to bed and the first thing i think of when i wake up
 its a fixation right now
it will pass soon
 i hope
 but in this state of mind its so difficult to do any of the things i know i need to do
i feel like i am caught in this cycle of severe depression/anxiety climbing up to "okay" or even "good"
 only to fall back to severe depression/anxiety
making bad decisions and having this repeating cycle
 i know i am able to not be in this cycle -- i did it for years so now i just need to let go
 there are so many ways to let go
the one that comes to mind most often is permanently letting go
 life-ending
 but i can choose to let go a more 'normal'/'right' way but just pulling my sh*t together
 why is that so hard
 why do i feel like i want to stay in this cycle
 what is it about this cycle that appeals to me
 does anyone relate to this
 am i crazy
 am i borderline personality disorder
 am i just dysfunctional
 i feel lost as to what exactly is wrong with me
how crazy am i
fuckkkkkkkk
why i never get laid
im just a fucking ulgy fat mug that never get a fucking girl
thats it im so fucking done with it
my feelings are constantly broken when it comes to a girl things
i just wanna have a fucking relationship with them
 is it too hard
i try everything that i can to get the girl
i've improve myself the best i can
 but still nothing came up
except more and more pain
 i can feel the pain inside
 so deep
i can't even cry
sorry for the caps lock
 but i feel sooooo bad about my self tonight
 please help
i thought that my childhood was normal until about a month ago
  now that i've realized that parts of it weren't normal
 memories are starting to come back
  a child shouldn't be told they are stupid and bad at certain things
  a child shouldn't be scared that a parent might lash out at them
i can't seem to recall any happy memories right now
  i know that they exist
 or at least i think they do
  i can only remember bad ones
 things i don't want to think about
  one would think that remembering about one's birthday should bring back happy memories
 but no
  i can only seem to remember the one that involved an outburst
it's like my entire world has been turned upside down
  i don't know what to think
 part of me wishes i had never discovered this
  but part of me is also glad
 since it explains so much about me
i am so confused right now
 i don't know what to think about all of this
"hi - i need to make an appointment to see dr b***** please"
"okay - the first appointment is 17th may"
"you're kidding
 over six weeks
 can i see a different doctor then please
"okay i can get you in on may 8th"
really
 to see a gp
grrrrrrr
i have been very panicky for the last 24 hours
 palpitations
 sweating
 fear
 anxiety
paranoia
 cannot control my thoughts and feelings
 i'm worrying over things that are ridiculous to worry about
 i know but it doesn't make it any less real but please tell the anxiety that
 i've taken my meds and still cannot calm the hell down
 any suggestions
 i am new here
 this is the second thread i started
 i guess
i am starting to suspect i have some degree of ptsd
 i think about the same bad events that happened in the past and worry if similar things will happen in the future
i try my best to avoid any triggers and if i get triggered
 i end up in a bad place emotionally
i know i have adhd and depression and residual social phobia but thats all that i am diagnosed with
i had a violent father and also was bullied by boys in high school
 specially because i wasnt attractive
 (high school bullies)
i am also a lesbian but it is because i am sexually attracted to women not because of my problems with males
anyway i have strong disgust for males now and i try my best to act like i dont
 i have it when they stare at me in places
 or when they try to hit on me even though i show that i am not interested or when they act bitter and hostile when i dont say ok to them
i hate their sexism homophobia ableism ageism racism
 i hate their strong efforts to make people who arent like them second class person
i dont even want to leave the home some days because i dont want to see some males' disgusting faces and stares
i hate talking to males because they say stuff like men are smarter than women or women gossip but men dont or womem should look after a family
 i just want to puke on their faces
so drained lately
  been frustrated more and more each day
 haven't been able to eat much
 just low on energy and things in this house isn't going well
  things needing to be done and i feel useless
  may have to call my dr in the morning and schedule an appointment
  foods are making me more nauseous
 and so ill
i'm new to the whole thought of actually opening up about myself and being 100% honest
 but not actually being known is the easiest way to do so
 i'm usually confused on my own feelings and have experienced many life changing events
 being able to have a place to speak my mind and not be judged in the slightest way
 brings a lot of comfort and ease with my constant anxiety
 i really do hope i can bring myself to post regularly now that i have found actual freedom to do so
hi everyone 
i guess this is going to be mostly a rant post but i'm honestly done with my life as it is now so i guess it's going to become a mess but i'll try my best to structure my post a bit
so first about my currently greatest problem: i am completely overworked
i know i should be taking off a day or at least half a day every week to rest and regain some energy
 i should be exercising to gain some abs and also release some endorphins
 i should also be solving more exercises to actually hand in some every now and then (i'm so glad this is not required at my school
 i should be learning more for my exams
 i should be organizing my lecture notes
 i should maintain a clean room and more funny stuff in the next point
 it's just too much and i don't feel like doing anything at all
 in all this i don't have any time for myself at all and the crazy thing is that if for once i have time for myself i don't know what do anymore
 i feel like i got completely lost in all this
so i guess this is already point two
 i feel damn lonely
 now social anxiety always held me back getting to know many people even before uni
 but it's a fact that in soon a year i only got to know around 5-10 people at uni and i don't really consider any of them to be a really close friend
 i guess i'm ok with not knowing too many people at uni though
 because there wouldn't be enough time to talk with people anyway (also most don't even live in my city and just commute here during the semester)
 it's more a problem that i don't really see myself getting to know any people outside uni either
 really when i don't have to go to uni i don't go anywhere at all
 i know i could go to the library
 and i did this a couple times
 but it's not like people go there to talk with other people and get to know them
 most are either only there to actually study or they are with friends they already know
 people on some forums suggested me i should be looking into clubs and all
 but first of all there aren't even that many at my uni and second as said i don't even really know what i want to do anymore
 i guess i'm ok with only having 2 or 3 friends from high school but as stupid it would be with my current life circumstances i still wished i had a boyfriend
  so far every love i had was a one sided crush
 that i'm gay doesn't make it any more likely for me to actually find someone
 i tried online dating in the past but guess what were my problems (a) weird people on there
 see potentially abusive partners everywhere (b) i don't even really know what i want in a relationship as said it probably would be just stupid right now (c) i'm absolutely boring
 i don't really have a life after all
 i wouldn't mind dating someone as boring as me but what are you supposed to talk with a person like that
 awkward silence because both people are boring as death
 i can have conversations with people about uni related stuff for hours
 great
 but this doesn't make me get to know people at all
 i wouldn't mind answering a couple questions about myself but i guess it's mostly going to bore the other person
now i know it's stupid to start a relationship or anything like that in my current situation since it could only go wrong
 but it honestly doesn't change the fact that i always end up developing feelings for someone who in my eyes showed me a bit more attention than the average joe
 it sucks
 it's really painful
 i don't want this anymore
 i now ended up crushing on an anime character
 i guess it's stupid but maybe you can figure how desperate i am in that regards
and lastly the feeling very lost part
 i guess i mentioned it a couple times already but i really don't see a nice feature anymore
 if i survive until then i will graduate in a couple years
 it will probably just be painful to look back and realize that i mostly wasted these years too
 i can't look back at all
 even right now
 but if i try to look into the future i just see the same void i expect to see in my past
 i am feeling fucking done
ok my rant is over
 i guess i got more negative towards the end
 sorry for writing all this shit here but it had to leave my head (although i don't expect it to not actually bother me again in like a couple hours or so you know)
 in case anyone is worrying i'm not actively suicidal because i still have some kind of (irrational) hope
 i'm just in a lot of pain
best regards
sa-chan
ps: i'm not new on the forum but i have been inactive for more than a half year now
 just in case someone was wondering
not sure why
 not sure if it's from my dream last night or because my youngest kept me up most of the night or something else
  i don't know
i don't come on sf anymore until i get really down
 which i guess is good
 i've been fighting this wave of depression like there's no tomorrow
 look i made a suicide pun
but i can't shake it
 it's tearing me apart
 i don't even care if my girlfriend comes over anymore
 she still does
 but it wouldn't matter if she didn't
 i've distanced myself from everyone again
 i hate this
 i just want it to go away
 i'm tired of feeling like this
 it's not all the time anymore
 which i guess is good
 but when it comes back
 oh god
 it comes back
 i guess that's what depression is
i'm twenty-two years old now
 when i first joined sf i was barely 15 and hanging on by a thread
 i had written myself a promise that i would not make it to my sixteenth birthday and even though i tried many times
 somehow i'm still here
 there has to be a reason
 right
some days i look at myself and i'm proud of everything i've accomplished
 but other days
 other days i sit here and wallow in the fact that i am still alive
 when friends ask me how i'm doing i say tired
 even though it's more than just your casual tired feeling
 i'm tired alright
 but i'm tired of life
 which i feel like is a different sort of tired
i'm waiting to wake up one day and be completely fine
 i want those days where yeah
 shit happens but it's not the end of the world instead of dreading waking up
 instead of having to force myself to get out of bed in the morning
or sometimes in the afternoon
or sometimes in the evening
i miss having actual friends
 people i could talk to when i was down and count on them to pick me back up again
 but this
 this is hell
how are you
i'm tired
 but i'm okay
 how are you
and then i listen to how they are because they don't know any better anymore and i'm not about to tell them i'm on the verge of suicide
 i'm not about to tell them i have planned this out again
it's odd how time flies and your plans when you were a kid seem so childish so you come up with new inventive plans
 but in the end
 it's still wrong
 why should any human feel the need to take their own life
 what is that
i stopped taking my medication again
 cold turkey
 almost three months ago and for the past almost month i can feel it
i don't even cry anymore
 but tonight
 tonight i'm bawling
tonight i'm sat here on the floor in my closet of all places and i'm fucking bawling
 i don't understand
i don't understand at all
today was back to school after 2 weeks off
 most people just hate going back because of learning
 but its different with me
 i'm scared to walk the halls without being pushed over or insulted
 i'm scared to put my hand up in lessons for fear of being wrong and being made fun of
 i'm scared to be alone for too long as i feel like everyone is staring at me
 i'm really insecure about my looks and feel like i'm ugly and horrible and that no-one actually likes me
 my self-esteem is horrible
 my anxiety kills me
 i can barely complete the simplest of tasks without having worrying or crying
 and last night i spent hours curled up crying
 trying not to hurt myself over going back to school
 i tried to convince myself i would be fine
 but it was all lies
today i got up and i skipped breakfast and spent my time in the bathroom putting as many different types of spot cream and dirt cleansers as i could as i have a lot of acne
 i hate looking at myself in the mirror and seeing my ugly
 spotty face
 i try my best to use my fringe to hide my face and eyes away
then when i got on the bus to go to school i started shaking and crying quietly because i was so scared of going to school
when i got to school and it was time for forms (20 minute registration classes at start of the day) i saw everyone else in my form standing with their friends
 waiting to go in
 chatting away
 but as usual i stood by myself
 then when we went inside for form i sat in my seat in silence and only spoke when my name was called out on the register
 i even hate hearing my name being called out for fear of being stared at
in first lesson (maths) we had moved seats and the teacher put us in new places
 i got put next to 3 other girls who i didn't talk to really
 but i could tell they didn't want me sitting with them
 then in 2nd lesson (pe) i took off my school blouse to put my pe shirt on and all my scars were on display
 no-one said a word but i caught one of my friends staring as i quickly put on my pe jacket to cover them up
 this term we were doing football  needless to say i'm horrible at pretty much every sport
 we got into small groups and did dribbling practise but i felt as if everyone was watching me the whole lesson as i was slow and really bad
at lunch (after 4th lesson) i sat down
 none of my friends had turned up yet
 so i sat by myself
 this boy who i knew came up to me and asked if he could sit with us
 some of my friends didn't like him but i wanted to be nice and i had nothing against him so i let him sit with us
 about 15 minutes later these boys came up to us and started bullying him (like they usually do)
 then because i was sitting next to him they started picking on me too
 it hurt more than anyone could think
 i let everyone else's words get to me
 i hate myself for that
 i froze up and sank in my seat
 letting them keep throwing words at me until the bell went for next lesson
 i just couldn't stand up for myself
 no matter how much i wanted to
in 5th lesson (biology) our teacher made certain students (including me) stand up and tell a fact about enzymes
 and although she knew i was really shy and i struggled a bit (because i had only just joined top set this year) she left me until last and i couldn't give a fact
 everyone watched me and eventually the teacher told me to sit down and went onto explaining today's lesson
 i bet everyone didn't care about the fact i couldn't give a fact but it stayed in my mind and i kept thinking that they were all staring at me and judging me
on the bus home this girl
 who was behind me
 started whispering my name
 taking my bag away and hiding it
 pulling/messing with my hair and saying things to me
 i didn't say much back
 i just sunk back into my seat
 turned up the music in my headphones and stared out the window
 even though it was all jokes it hurt me and i just wanted to be left alone
when i got home i just started crying and just started talking and cuddling with my rabbits and cried
 i feel like they are the only ones that listen
 my friends say i can talk to them but i'm scared to because i feel like i'm bothering them
 that i'm making everything about me and that they really don't care about me
 my brain is really hurting
 i can't sleep
 i barely get any sleep nowadays
 i keep trying to not eat and drink
 i haven't drunk anything in a few days
 and i haven't eaten anything for nearly two days
 my head takes over me
 thanks for reading if you got this far
 it means a lot
 this is only scratching the surface of how i feel
i started to get excited when i saw 'suicide
 10 methods to die'
 i know i don't read things properly because i'm so distracted with pain but i really did have some hope there until i read it
 i thought it would give hope to people like me with proper decent advice on how to end your life
 there are people like me who are desperate to go
 i mean desperate to die
 seeing that written on this site gave me the biggest buzz in years that i might get decent advice
 but it turned out to be a cruel lie
 it was not a method in how to end your suffering
 it was some kind of information on what makes people want to die
 well anyone coming on this site knows only too well what makes people want to die
 people like me don't want to be persuaded to live we just want help in ending it as it's so painful to live this life
 in my case it's mainly physical pain and feeling trapped that makes me want to die
 i am alone
 without help and disabled in my flat and ignored mainly by the state
 they give me meds for my physical condition which has no effect and i have not got out of my flat in over a decade
 i would have done a lot better if i had committed some awful crime and been doing time in a prison cos they let you have an hour of sun there a day i've been lead to believe
 i used to be a sun worshiper and it worked as an anti-depressant for me when i was out on my bike all the time
 the nearest i get to the sun is seeing it on the net
 i'm very bitter about my situation and just want to not be here
 i have no friends
 no nothing except a very aware brain that makes every second of this living hell feel like a million years
 just saying
 don't give people hope when there is none
 it's downright mentally cruel
 really cruel cos i thought any advice on this site would be proper medical advice on how to die in the best way possible with no pain
 cos after all the only reason i want to get out is because i'm in intense pain
hey guys
 something happened to me a couple of nights ago and it's really stuck with me ever since
 i guess i mainly need to vent
 but i'm hoping that i can also find some reassurance and hope
first of all
 i suppose it's relevant to say that i'm kind of skinny
 and i have been my whole life
 i feel it's important to mention that i am naturally skinny
 despite the fact i did also suffer from an eating disorder in my teen years
 at school
 i would starve myself
 naturally
 my classmates would think that my small frame was entirely due to the fact that i never ate
 this would be an understandable assumption to make
 however
 i am just a thin girl in general
 i am in remission from my eating disorder and have been for almost a decade
 and yet i am still thin
 because it's just how my body naturally is
 however
 whenever i try to explain this to people
 even people who i thought weren't the judgemental type
 they would still look at me in disbelief and dismiss the idea
 it's quite bizarre really
 because i could eat as much as i want in front of people when i finally became comfortable with it
 and they would still assume that my skinny frame was to do with some kind of mental illness like bulimia
 it's very frustrating to have this label pinned on me for as long as i remain thin
this has been an infuriating topic for me for a long time
 ever since the media got involved
 it became fashionable to be a "curvy" girl
 and if you were skinny then you weren't a "real girl"
 this is still very true today
 and i witness this sickening show too regularly for me to handle
 it's all well and good to empower women who may not have felt comfortable in their skin because they thought they were a little overweight
 but to shun and spread hate towards skinny girls in the process is disgusting to me
 yes
 it's great to spread awareness of being healthy
 as in
 eating right and exercising
 but a lot of people seem to have no idea that healthy bodies can come in all shapes and sizes
 i eat a lot more than people might imagine
 and i exercise regularly
 and because i am still thinner than average
 people assume that i'm sick or that there's something wrong with me
 or that i need to eat more in order to look "normal"
while this has angered me for many years
 it never really bothered me to the point of taking action
 because i knew that there would always be people in this world who would be judgemental and ignorant
 so i just let it happen
 i let it slide
 and focused on the people who cared for me and believed in me
 however
 the one person i thought i could trust the most
 ended up becoming one of the judgemental types
my best friend couldn't stop commenting on my weight when i saw her a few days ago
 she kept staring at me
 making me hugely uncomfortable
 it even looked like she had a hint of disgust in her eyes
 she said that i needed to eat more
 that i needed to put on more weight
 that i looked sick
 while i understand that she may have been concerned because she thought i genuinely wasn't eating enough
 the truth was that i had been eating plenty
 and i was finally getting to the point where i felt really good about myself
 until she broke that all down with just a few words and looks
 i'm still so taken aback
 because until now she was never the sort of person to bring another person down for something as superficial as looks
i now have a stupid desire to eat more junk food and to actually gain weight in a massively unhealthy way just so i can get those judgemental eyes off me
 which is surely the opposite effect that people should be going for
 i now hate the way i look
 despite the fact that i am the healthiest i have ever been
 i feel like i've gone back to my teen years
 despising what i see in the mirror just because i don't fit society's standards of what a "real girl" should look like
 not once in my life have i shunned a certain body type
 not once have i judged someone for being overweight
 yet when a girl is underweight or even just a bit thin like i am
 then it seems like it's perfectly acceptable to throw insults around
 do skinny girls not have feelings
 why is it hugely shocking to insult an overweight girl
 but everyone laughs and claps when a skinny girl gets the hate
 i'm getting to the point of wondering if anyone even sees me as a human being any more
 i try so hard to treat my body with all the respect it deserves
 especially after how poorly i treated it during my teen years
 and just because i haven't gained the weight that people expect me to
 i'm still just a disgusting twig in their eyes
i'm sorry for venting so much
 i'm hoping that i'm not alone here
 because right now
 that's how i feel
i am so extremely weary
 fighting to get my clients what they are owed and need to survive is getting so much harder
 kafka would be proud
 the victim blaming rhetoric is really starting to get me angry
 then laugh at them with contempt and scorn when they come to me for help
 ÛÏi am sorry due to funding cuts you are on your own
 i would direct you to other services but they have gone under
 please now rely on 'big society
' born of political spin and equally as empty
  if that means starvation and death well that is your own fault for some reason i can't fathom
 but apparently it is
  be careful not to become homeless as it is the equivalent of being a criminal
 but you can legally sleep in a snow bank
i go to bed angry and wake up angry
 this anger is seeping into everything
 it is useful to an extent
 it allows me to wage psychological warfare and be so persistently stubborn i may as well be the earth's axis
 but the earth's axis does not get demoralised or suffer burn out or need to eat
 i am haunted by the dead and the stories they told
 aware how badly they were treated and how they do not exist in official statistics
 but their gravestones and family grief is very real regardless of what the numbers don't say and government tries to cover up
 seems compassion and human decency is no longer cost effective
 i am so tired but i cannot stop
 compassion and rage are food for the fight but i am exhausted
 it has certainly affected my capacity to write and sleep
im just tired
 it never ends
 either i am depressed one day or angry the next
 im never happy
 im barely ever "content"
 and thats all i want
is to be emotionally neutral
 completely void
 un-exaggeratingly apathetic
 (not sure if that is a word but it is now)
 motivation for more than rehearsals
 for more than finding the perfect place for my body to be discovered
 how about motivated to wake up
 not even for work
i spoke to my therapist
 her immediate reaction was to put me on a hold
  i spoke to my pcp
 her reaction was to panic and get a therapist who considered putting me on a hold (i kept most details private)
 i told a friend and again
 panic instead of letting me talk
  i have been as far as having plan and date time to complete it
 that was two weeks ago
  i still struggle with the thoughts
 but without the obsessiveness
i flat out told the professionals that if you started writing those holds i would leave
  all you were doing was causing me to go into hiding
 probably in a hotel
 without being able to contact anyone
  not exactly what i needed
yes its scary stuff
 but i thought with my therapist i would be safe enough to speak the whole truth
  we worked it out in the end
 but i still have some misgivings
gotta go
  will let more out later
 i didnt want to create this thread but now i feel like i have to
i take comcerta for attention deficit disorder
 i feel like my mood is changing dangerously
 i feel powerful and suicidal
 both of these moods last hours
i wanted to give medication time to see if this effect would go
also i was very depressed when i first started my therapy for adhd
 it was one or two months ago and i was so depressed i wasnt even able to wash my face
so i feel like medication isnt the only cause of my problem but it makes my mood very worse
what do you think
 should i stop medication or should i call my psychiatrist
we have only strattera
 medikinet
 ritalin and concerta here
 i tried them all
 i have no other choice left
 this is why i am afraid to call my psychiatrist
because i dont know if he can do anything
each day seems to be the same darkness
 i wish i could find hope
 but the same feelings are there to torment me
 i've tried to be strong all my life
 but this is the greatest challenge i've encountered and wares me down
i don't know what to do anymore
 i don't have the courage to make that final commitment and i don't have the courage to live
 i'm just venting
 i know there are no answers
 we each face our own individual battles in our own way
 my heart goes out to all on this forum who are hurting
 bless you all and may you find relief
brian
i'm still at my mum's place
 which is a bad place for me to be
 but sometimes you have to certain things
 tomorrow we're going to an intimate family lunch
 well
 just the 4 of us in my closest family
i did a lot of things to navigate through the day
 my aunt came to visit as my mother was cooking pancakes
 my aunt is constantly negative about anything and anyone while she just sits on her bum
 and won't listen when mum tells her not to chase the dog around the house
 he's getting old
 and she overfeeds the cats
 and one of them has digestive problems
 i guess she means well
 but yea
i did things to avoid arguments from happening
 small things like me going to get her coat from my mum's bedroom
 the cats are not allowed in there
 but my aunt never remembers to close the door behind her
 when my aunt was complaining about stuff i found the silver lining
and i took the dog for a walk
 for my own sake too
 i needed air
 and i guess sunshine is healthy for you
 both physically and mentally
the dog loves to go to the field next to mum's house
 there's a road there and he's allowed to run on the field without a leash
 (technically legally you're not allowed to let a dog loose on public ground though) but no one ever comes there
 well almost never
walking back home the school where i was severely bullied for 8 years and sexually abused was in full view
 if you wanted to take a promotional picture of that school you would do that from the top of that field
 i gulped
 but i got a bright idea
 i sat myself down on the side of the road
 called the dog over; had music in one ear and calmed myself as much as i could and forced myself to look at the buildings
 technically it's just bricks and mortar now
 but i need to get over my mortal fear
 i get so sick when i get too close and that's not fair i have to be 26 and be so dead afraid of a school i left when i was 14
but suddenly the dog ran away from me
 and what was actually a sort of good moment became one of stress
 two women had found the road and decided to walk it with their tiny dog
 i can't blame them
 it's a pretty walk
 micky
 my mum's dog ran from me towards them
 he loves people
 he thinks they all love him
 he hadn't noticed the dog
 i walked after him
 i can't run because of my spine and hip and tried to command him to stop
 he did but just as i was about to click the leash on him he ran again
 he actually reached the women and i managed to call out to them that he's not dangerous
one lady took their dog in her arms and the other one caught micky
 luckily he was wearing a brace so he was easy to grab and was just wagging his tail
 i told them i was so sorry and they took it pretty well
it just undid what i tried to do
i don't know
 i feel a bit weird tonight
 thinking back i am realizing i did all the wrong things
i was one again avoiding by changing my aunts subjects
 helping my mum extra in the kitchen so my mum would get less frustrated about my aunt
 i stepped right back into my old role
i was told to focus on doing things i like
 things that make me happy
 not what other people expect of me
 or even what i assume that they expect
 the therapist i talked to at the psych er a week ago told me that
 as things are right now
 with me starting therapy and opening up so many bottled things and so much abuse; the last thing i need is to fulfill others expectations
 i need to be kind to me
 and i undid all that today
i have to admit it feels a bit weird
 but in a way it makes sense
 i just feel like i'm supposed to be a 'good girl' and get a job and work hard
 my mum told me they were seeking a medical secretary at an ear doctor in this town
 i told her i'd look at it
i won't though
 i know i can't work now
 i wish i could
 but i can't
 and this entire town feels like a trigger
 i am always scared i'll meet someone who used to bully me
 i still have my dentist here
 one of the assistants is one of those girls
ear doctors are another trigger for me
 i had a really nice ear doctor as a kid
 i have always had really bad ears and have had so many infections and had to have operations to drain fluids
 today i am almost deaf on one ear and partially deaf on the other
 under one of the sessions with the ear doctor when i was around 10 he drained my ears with a very noisy apparatus and by accident ruptured my eardrum
 after that i felt actual dread having to go there
 i even threw up before sessions
 during one session mum managed to drag me to i was covering my ears and screamed "don't touch me
and we stopped coming
 i went to an ear doctor a few years ago
 as a grown woman and i felt just as sick
 i had told the ear doctor about my fears and she was really nice about it
  and it turns out my hearing was a lot better than i knew
so uhm
 yeah
 don't really think i'll work at such a place
it does feel weird to focus on me rather than finding work (to be perfectly honest i would rather live off of writing or something similar from home rather than having to work)
  i just don't think i'm cut out for a job
 but who knows who i'll be when i've been helped
 i am supposed to fill my life with things i like to do
 luckily filming of my favourite tv show is starting very
 very soon and i'll be following that daily online
 that always gives me a rush
 i spend my days talking to my ldr boyfriend
 i try to do things like draw and i hope to get back to crocheting and maybe even painting
 i am tempted to when i feel better and see what it takes to get into an acting school as well
 i took all the acting classes i could in school
 it gave me a great chance to be someone else; and it helped me with my stutter brought on by bullying
i just
 yeah
 it takes times to get used to the idea that it's okay to do things that makes me happy
 and not what others expect
 i lived my entire life trying to be a good girl
 hoping if i was someone might like me
 or at least not hit me
i'm not sure if this is the right place but i didn't really know where to put it
to someone whom i was very close to
 like family
i am sorry i hurt you
 i'm sorry that i abandoned you
but sorry is only a word and not comforting or helpful
i have stayed away and yet i long to talk to you again
but i don't want to mess up your life
i hope that you were able to heal and move on
i hope you found someone better
most of all i hope that you never get let down again
surround yourself with good people
i think of you daily even though we do not talk anymore
i have gotten to the point where i no longer care about school
 if i fail or not
 i don't know if it is because i am so simply so fed up with the feeling that i know what i want to do with my life but my current academic trajectory is nowhere near my goal
 that my current degree path is leading me slowly towards a life of  "quiet desperation"
 monotony
 and the functional alcoholism of my father
 that should i fail
 i will be subjected to the whim of fate
 hoping that some driven enough and foolish enough lifts me from my willful trek towards hopelessness
 the alternate fate of my mother
 it may simply be a result of my lazy nature coupled with my disconsolate disposition
 in reality i may simply be suffering from depression
at any rate this is how the story goes
 about a month ago i started noticing it was harder to focus
 i have ad/hd and focus is hard to come by as it is but the inability was novel
 no matter how hard i tried
 nothing i attempted could manage to bring my focus in long enough to be productive
 even when i could strong arm my mind into focusing my brain seemed incapable of comprehending the most simple tasks
 i couldn't read
 there has been several dozen situations in the last month where i would sit down for a minimum of an hour and get nothing done
 whether it was reading
 writing
 researching
 whatever
 the closest thing i'd gotten to success was with "reading"
 i would stare at some form of written material and bounce my eyes from one word to the next but it was as though i was reading some foreign language
school is almost over(in 2 weeks) i dont think i can call for an incomplete and i am spending all of my energy just trying to just stay alive
 not run away
 not relapse into drugs
 i can't do amy work anymore but i feel like i can't tell anyone because they would just dismiss it as being lazy
 and i am afraid they would be right
i just don't know what to do anymore and as i move forward i often find my myself contemplating how such an inability will play itself out moving forawrd
 it usually starts off in my mind as failing a class
 then failing multiple classes
 then dropping out of school as a result of lack of motivation
 and then getting a deadend/minimum wage job at mcdonalds
 followed some time down the line by an eclipsing depression based in the fact that my life has become the punch line of some tragic joke
 and eventually commiting suicide
 this is all to say that by that point i have not already relapsed into major drug abuse and am either in jail
 fatally overdosed
 or trapped in some form of permanent psychosis as a result of drug abuse or the degenerative nature of schizophrenia
i do not want to commit suicide but life is beginning to seem progressively more and more pointless and i fear my already lacking willpower will not be enough to prevent me from acting out of impulse
 although i hate the idea of me living no more would the world stop turning
 even if it were just my family to feel the pain would whatever family i have whereever down the line not feel the pain
 one way or another we are all headed there eventually
 and our loved ones should we be so fortunate will all feel it eventually
 what is the point of enduring so much pain and senseless confusion and agony for only a relatively minor amount of joy/satisfaction of the course of such time
in my mind if one cannot positively and significantly effect a number of lives that sums up to a number greater than they would hurt if they were dead is a waste of resources
 i hate the fact that i look at life so mathematically
 black/white
 emotionally irrelevant
 but it is how i truly view the world and it terrifies me
 but what terrifies me even more is the fact that i am growing to accept this way of thinking as fact
 no longer as simply the whimperings of my poor depressed soul
it has been awhile since i have posted
 i have recently crashed hard
 unsure how to put it
  quit living would be best i suppose
 lost job
 lost friends
 lost home
 this has occurred over the course of 4 months
 all the while i put up a front of happiness and stability
i am shaky and afraid
 was released from the hospital about ten hrs ago
 (currently in a safe place) go back in the morning for my fourth ect treatment
 spent 2 weeks on the psych ward after i was determined to be a threat/harm to myself
 this is now the second time that the police have brought me in
 currently on 4 different meds
feeling very ashamed
unsure if i have the strength to get through this
very ashamed
hi everyone
i'm having a really bad day
 i need to talk to someone before i lose it
i keep having these repetitive negative thoughts that are making me depressed
 i've been insecure all my life
 and it feels like its getting worse
 "i'm worthless
 i'm not good enough
 i'm not smart enough
 i am a burden to others"
 and lately i've been having suicidal thoughts again
 "just do it
 nobody will miss me
 it will be better if you're out of their lives"
 i'm afraid that one day i can't stand it anymore
 i don't want this
 i want to be happy
 i want to make my partner happy
 trying so hard to change myself
 but the more i try the more upset i get that i'm not moving forward fast enough
 i'm afraid i'll never change
 my partner is the sweetest guy ever
 he's been really patient with me
 but i see he's losing his patience
 he acts cold now when i'm feeling sad
 doesn't ask whats wrong
 and i completely understand
 if you see someone sad everytime
 you'll get tired of it
 i'm so afraid i'll lose him
 and whats hurting me the most
 i keep telling myself that
 "youre losing him
 look hes upset with you
 he must be tired of you
 he's going to leave you"
 i want these thoughts to stop
 i cant take it anymore
 i dont know what to do
the suicide/depression paradox hurts me
it just strikes me as weird that the way the general public views depression and suicide actually works to suffering people feel even more unworthy of life
on the one hand: people tell me that i have a moral or ethical duty to live
 and not just to live
 but to be happy and productive
 even though i have no family that wants anything to do with me
 no friends whatsoever
 no pets
 a job i hate that expires in june and no prospects of getting another job
 but must live like this and like it
 out of adherence to an abstract social pronouncement
on the other hand: people tell me that depressed and suicidal people like me are the worst people ever
 that they don't want me around
 they won't love or befriend me
 help me or even talk to me
 i've been called a shithead
 a worthless piece of shit
 a bullshit artist
 an ingrate
 a retard
 a coward
 a cop-out
 a criminal (and that's just my mother
 they sneer at me for not going to a therapist and also scorn me for not being able to fix myself on my own (this is my step-father and sister)
people say i want to be depressed
 it's all my fault because i'm actively trying to be unhappy
 out of spite to them or because i was spoiled when young
 i'm told i'm not unhappy because of  physical or emotional abuse nor my social awkwardness; and besides
 i invite that on myself for being unhappy
so if i'm so awful
 why do i have this weird duty to live
 isn't such a failure of a human being doing everyone a favour by taking herself out of their way
 my family/ acquaintance/ culture isn't even religious so it's not as though they're working within a moral framework that accepts adherence to this type of rule
 and this paradox is the only one that exists
 the only one without moral grey areas
i'm struggling and i really just need to vent
why do anything in our life's
 everything and i mean everything is just passing time until the end comes
study
work
reading
watching tv
 going for a walk
it's all just to pass time
and don't get me wrong i know some of those activities bring success enjoyment at fun and some don't
yes some are more time wasters than others
but it's still all the same
i hate my brain its my own worst enemy
i try n think of things to do and then i get about a million different reasons as to why it's pointless and shouldn't do it
i'm tied
and my soul and brain need a rest as well
so i went to bed 'early' (meaning midnight) because i have a therapy session today and wanted to have some sleep behind me to help me be more robust
of course my back and hip wouldn't allow that ro happen
chronic pain sucks so bad sometimes
tonight i feel i'm at my ends
 i feel like this endless battle should really be ending soon
 do i sound suicidal
 to be honest with you
 i am not sure if i want to die or just be numb
 i am sick of fighting
 i feel so sad and angry all at the same time
i feel so empty
 hollow
 everything feel so meaning less
 i just wish i had someone anyone that actually wanted to talk to me
 instead of me always harassing people
 i spend hours debating if i should post or not
i am so worthless and not worth anything
 yet i still crave having somebody that actually wants to talk to me
 i'm so lonely
 i hate being desperate yet it's all i feel i am
 nothing seem to have much meaning for me 
 everything is so dark my heart feels black
 i'm not sure i'll ever get it back
 i hate myself more than anyone ever could
so the problem is that i always feel so conflicted about everything
 i always feel like i'm going to make a mistake or make the wrong decision
 if i don't have someone standing behind me and telling me what to do
 i don't do anything because i don't know what to do
 the other problem is that on top of the fact that i feel like a failure
 i feel like i just annoy everyone
 in fact
 i know that i annoy everyone
 i mean when you start talking and everyone just turns away
 it's a really big sign that you're annoying
 right
 everyone hates me
i don't have anyone to talk to about it
 my only friends are audrey and shannon
 and i think even try get sick of me some times
 anyways
 i can't tell audrey about how i feel
 she goes through it too so she has herself to worry about
 and she'll just think i'm obnoxious trying to talk to her while she's trying to deal with her own problems
 i can't talk to shannon
 she just talks about how god will help me or whatever
 and i just don't believe that
 on top of that
 she is going through a lot right now anyways
 she doesn't need to have to worry about me too
 and i can't talk to my family about it
 they think it's just all my fault that i feel this way
 everything is my fault
 they say i'm just lazy and a liar and all this stuff
 they don't believe in me
 they don't think i can do anything right
 i tell them how i feel and they tell me to suck it up
 they won't take me to see a therapist anymore because the last therapist i went to didn't help me
 which is of course my fault
the insecurities are the worst though
 i think they cause most of the anxiety
 i'm insecure about my personality: i feel like i'm annoying and sometimes off-standish
 and so i get anxiety in any social situation
 i'm super insecure about my body
 oh my god
 that's the worst
 i'm always sucking in my stomach trying to be skinnier and trying not to jiggle
 i don't want to give people a reason to make fun of me
 i try to lose weight and i just fail at it
 i'll exercise for a few days but then lose motivation
 i eat all the time
 i can't control myself
 if i'm sad
 i eat
 and i'm sad all the time
 i just wish i could be skinny
 i wish i could be less annoying
 i wish i could actually do something right for once
 i wish i didn't feel like such a failure
 i just wish i wasn't me
life has been hard and i find myself wishing i was dead
 but for some reason
  i fear death when the suicidal thoughts aren't there
  i don't know why
 i think i may die soon anyways
 not sure how
 but the thoughts are there
 i don't know  how to stop thinking of death or how it may be
 i just want to enjoy life and those that are in it instead of dreading every moment of it and being scare of death to begin with
 some times
 i don't understand myself
realized that i forgot to take my meds yesterday
 took it this morning
  everything towards the end of the day was crashing down on me emotionally
  i started getting suicidal thoughts again
  better today
  i just got to remember to take my meds on time
