 do you have any plans for this evening
 that sounds good
so this jack guy is basically the luckiest man in the world
 because he's survived like 5 attempts on his life and it's not even noon
no; he could totally nail those two chicks
could you tell me where the auditorium is
it's on the second floor
 you mean it's actually in the building
 it's not like i ever plan on giving birth
 if your mother gave birth
 it's like your chances are good that you'll give birth too
 mother gave birth
i don't mind getting old; i love getting old
 just as long as you don't get pregnant
can you spare any change
who the hell you saying no to
 i wasn't asking you anyway
 this is a picture of my daughter sofiya
 she was in a fire recently and now she is brain damage can you spare some change so that we can give her a proper funeral
 anything will help
 even a penny
 is this the same daughter that was in a fire last summer
 you mean to tell me you haven't buried her yet
how old are you
 i never answer that question
 because to me
 it's about how mature you are
 a fourteen year old could be more mature than a twenty-five year old
 i just never answer that question
 you're older than eighteen
what should i get
 i'll have a falafel
i'll have one of these lamb slices
 one of these
 it looked like lamb
i'm gonna throw caution to the wind and get a cheese slice
 maybe you should ask for a duck confit slice
there's kosher salt in the bacon
 you just picked your nose
 you're not gonna wash your hands first
 it's not like i picked your nose
you're the first person i've seen that washed their hands before going to the toilet
my godfather was a doctor and he got it into my head at a young enough age that i had to always do it
 he must have been a bit of a strange doctor
he specialized in infectious diseases
why do i have to die
 why can't you die
you are the most beautiful woman in the world
she has crabs 
what can i say
 i'm a sucker for orphan stories
think about it: i loved lemony snicket
 party of five 
 diff'rent strokes 
 star wars 
 luke wasn't an orphan
 he sort of was
i could be fired for 8 counts of sexual harassment last night
 and that's just on me alone
 but you bought me a drink
 so it's okay
i really like sleep sex
 when you're sleeping and you wake up and you're having sex
you mean getting raped
 will you remember me tomorrow
will you remember me next week
 you forgot me already
bitches are all emotional
 guys use their head
 that is why i call emotional guys "bitches
but bitches are crazy
 they will call the cops on you now
 they will slap themselves in the face and when the cops show up they will point at you
that is why i ain't got no kids
 i don't want a bunch of my seed running around and people calling me a scumbag because i don't take care of my kids
 bitch will turn on you for that child support
i know my girl ain't gonna be doing that because she know i'm only making minimum wage
 i got lots of candy and everyone wanted to play with me and i used to wet the bed a lot
you used to what
i used to wet the bed
 so they decided to move my bed farther away from the bathroom
i'm gonna call that number 1-800-divorce
 i want to divorce my parents
you can't divorce your parents
 can you marry your parents
 technically you can but that's just sick
you're not really divorcing your parents
 it's more like they giving up they rights
 i call it divorcing your parents because that's what they called it on the simpsons so that's why i say it
that used to be a fun place
 remember that backroom
 that was a fun backroom
 it was a nasty firetrap full of gropey old trolls
 people came on me without my permission 
 and i had my wallet stolen
 i thought you were someone else
 what nice bebbies
 i have a child too
 the doctor told me wife
 no more chidren for you
 who is that man
 not your grandmother
her boss made her lift a 500 pound piano all by her self
 a tiny woman
 a 500 pound piano
so no more children
 and me one of nine
 including the one deadborn one
why did you cut your knish like you're an asian person
because i'm a 
 you are one crazy cookie
i have never seen so many chinks in one starbucks in all my life
 the third time they've made me feel stupid in public
 i hate chinese people
i think its a complete failure as an expression of ideology
 but it is aesthetically pleasing
so i had ex sex last night
 but now i'm fucked cause she's gonna start calling me again
 you sleep with someone and then they call you
why isn't she smiling
 the french gave her to us
 smiling is an american thing
listen to your mother
 she knows a lot
 tell your brother to go back to prison

 your money is fake
my money is real

 they brought jesus back from the dead
 my feets is killin' me
 i's goin' home
 gettin' in bed
 put on the tv
change your name to saran
 'cause it's a wrap
your room always smells so good
 like coconuts and coffee
 it reminds me of the caribbean
 what kind of candles do you have
that's not from a candle
 the coconut is from the foot cream i use so my feet don't stink and the coffee smell is there because i spilled some on my carpet and never cleaned it up
where can i get the foot cream
could someone spare some change
 my welfare was denied
 they denied mine the first time too
 get over it
does anyone know how to get to--
 they aren't going to talk to you
 they can't talk
 they are all mute
 you'd look good with that girl up there in the pink checked coat
i think this is it
you'd think they'd have signs or something
 this must be it
this one is awesome
 chicks love it
 if you're into that kind of thing

i can't believe i was cockblocked by the l train
 i have some leftover vietnamese food you can have
 what is it
 i don't eat pork
 it's just vegetarian noodles
 i'm trying to cut back on carbs
i need a woman to love me so i can alienate her
 the love part
 that's where it gets difficult
 it's so easy to find a needy bitch
have you tried aa
i haven't seen our homeless guy lately
we have a homeless guy
 the guy who lives on that mattress under our building
i hope he's okay
 i haven't seen him all week
you know you're a new yorker when you worry about where your homeless guy is
if you come in and dance with me
 i'll buy you a drink
 there's a five dollar cover
if you come in and dance with me
 i'll give you five dollars
i think you're hot
 you're setting yourself on fire
i'm on fire for you
why do the buildings in new york have water tanks on the
maybe they knock it over if the building
 i really need to listen to more rap
 you don't need to listen; you need to live it
i didn't want to listen to my dad explain sex to my mom
why would your dad explain sex to your mom
because my brother asked what the song
 "come my lady
 come my lady" meant
 and mom didn't know
what does that song have to do with sex
 you're the only person in the world who doesn't know
your brother didn't know
my brother is 7
 that's the first thing i learned when i moved here: don't eat street meat
 it's probably pigeon or something
 i wish i could get my husband to stop eating it
i don't care what kind of meat it is as long as it's in my mouth
that's my sister; she's looking for a hook-up
that cap belongs on your head
it on my head
 i ran away once
 my parents were making me study for a science test
 you don't have any problems
 my parents are making me get a job
not having money to buy food is a 
 not having an is a problem
don't you with 
you sleep with a different guy every night

 you want to 
 i've had enough
 i don't have to take this anymore
 did you see that girl who just left
 i just dumped her
 can i buy you two a drink
do you guys sell bling
all the way in the back
 under the skeleton pimp
i'm like your gay boyfriend
only without the gay sex part
 and without the sense of style
i don't know if i'd say that
 you're just very emotional
 but you should really work on the style
 'cause it's the best thing about the gay
wait for the next one
 this is too packed
 i have to be on this train
this isn't the train to heaven
 going to queens
one pack of parliament lights
 i'm actually 22
 you look like you are 10
 i like that
 the subway runs express out of astoria and local into astoria
 it wouldn't make sense any other way
 see all the people on the train
why would it only run express one way
you're not from here
 i don't expect you to understand
you wanna hear something
one side of my hair grows faster than the other
 the right side grows faster than the left side
 and i have to show up at a salon and have them cut off the right side but not the left
i keep getting screwed over on my haircuts
 last time they left it way too shaggy in the back
 and this time it's much too short
 i need to find a stylist i can stick with
 so your hair is like shlong or something
 "shlong" means "penis" in yiddish
 i didn't know that
i sure hope i don't have a penis growing out the back of my head
so my brother's bar mitzvah is this saturday and he asked me to cut off my hawk for it so i cut it off
 but on sunday i am going to dye it black with orange tips
 a bit late
 but it'll look good
 i thought i passed you the other day
 it couldn't be him
 he wouldn't grow his hair that long
 i grew it out
you look like axl rose
it's more of a southern rock thing really
 like a my morning jacket look

 and there's a weird guy staring at us
 what have we got to lose
 there's this dog called perhaps that hangs around here
 yours looks just like it

 what kind of person marches their daughter into their sixth grade class and announces that their daughter just ate a whole chicken
 who does that
 i never forgave her for that
if i ever become a cannibal
 now i'll know what cuts of meat to ask for
i had a turkey injected with pomegranate juice once
 it was very delicious
 if i'm really hungry it doesn't matter about morals anymore
 i'll just dive right into bacon
 forget about the vegan thing
 so for god's sake don't ever leave me alone with bacon
so i actually tried garlic knots one day when i wasn't high and i was like
and there's really garlic on them
 not hungry like i want to eat
when i was young
 my mother used to make so much carbonated food
 can i have a pizza with no cheese
this day is going by fucking slow; it's only 1:30pm
my eye is going to fall out
 so what do you want for dinner again
 attention all units
does anyone want chinese food
 i work at mcdonalds; they spit in all your food
 i swear to god
don't get too close to paul because if he busts ass it's going to smell like y2k
please do not disturb the canine dogs
we used to have a bunny just like that one
 then we had to take it to the liquor store
my dog tail is too long
 i wanna cut it off
i just got a friendster request from a dog
everyone has a fucking pit bull
it's like everyone on myspace suddenly got a pit bull
 now that i don't have a girlfriend
 i should get a dog
 isn't that how it works
she was happier than a pig having 50 orgasms
so we were talking about how warm it was out
 so he says
 "that stupid fucking groundhog is always wrong
 and i says
 "you stupid fucking bastard
 that ain't 'til february
you're like a hamster in bed
 i've got two dogs here
 animals can't see you know
 i'm riding into the future
you are requested to be at your gate for your non-stop flight to jfk
quit fucking around on the sidewalk
next guest with 10 items or less
 not ten and a half
 what the fuck is that
 i'm pretty fabulous; i don't need you to come down
 $100 for pills that aren't even for something that important
it's not like they're aids pills
he says it's better
 but i just say it's cheaper
 eighty percent of twenty-five
 take thirty off of that
 i'm looking at houses
you tell her that i'll lower it down to $50 for her
 and you can assure her
 she'll be satisfied at least 3 times
you just spent $200 on dinner and you can't spend $2 on a metrocard
 so i was talking to the guys about getting a pull-out couch so i could stay over
 but then max said i would have to give sexual favors for money if i wanted to stay there
 are you selling freud by any chance
the fuckin' r train is a motherfuckin' myth
 i swear to god
 it's the fuckin' unicorn: only fools and virgins can see it
i wish i had a shyster lawyer
 it's my fantasy in life just to be left alone
i hope the new xbox has a vagina
 i thought wrestling was real
"close my eyes and think of england
" in all my born days
 i never thought someone would ever say that to me
 i met you
i wanna like move to a faraway island with a mute sex slave and lots of indigenous pot
that's all i really need because i can talk to them and they can hear
but they can't respond
and they'll just express themselves through sex
like when they're mad it will get rough
and when they arent mad it will be gentle like the motherfucking ocean
so you're taping 4 to 5 people in a row
if hitler were still alive and he were gay you would have thought he'd decorated that apartment
 it was a soulless aesthetic abomination
 me neither; if you are ugly you at least have to be nice
i saw a woman with half a head
 literally half a head
 she had this indentation in her left hemisphere where they had taken out her skull to remove her brain
 i almost barfed
 but i didn't
 i'll draw your picture
 make you look like chewbacca
 i can't do it
 nigga look like mumm-ra from the thundercats
carson daly looks like a colostomy bag
with cocoa butter on it
and every time she'd yell at me for something i just wanted to be like
you know when you look at someone and you can just tell they're a douchebag
 like they have a douchebag face
 i hate people like that
i got guys asking me to send them pictures of my cooter
 it's like guys know when you're taken; they flock to you like bees to moldy bread
you know who's got it tough
 those girls in africa getting there clits cut off
i mean sometimes i can't afford a cup of coffee but at least i still have my clit
 i worship the ground between her legs
 i'm not going to eat just anyone's pussy
 but i'm going to with strangers
i just described my pussy as "vagically delicious
" and i wanted to leave you a message because i thought you would appreciate that
 that felt like vaginal secretion
just tell him you have genital sores
 don't take it personally
 the main detective guy from law & order: svu guest stars as a pediatrician on 
 i could never imagine him doing the things he's doing right now
 you know he was on and he was a gay prisoner and he liked getting it in the ass and giving it too
 is english a race
 that's going on overheard tomorrow
 i really like your red hair
 that's why i dye it
 but i don't like it nearly as much as i like not being interrupted when i am tryng to talk to someone
are you going this way
 i'm not turning around
 i'm not hitchhiking
 i'm fucking paying you
 and if i tell you to turn around you damn well better turn around
 fuck you too
 you need therapy
 you need to stop sucking dick
 and a haircut
 that's pretty big
and it won't stop growing
i think you need a doctor
 what am i supposed to say
 my penis just won't stop growing"
maybe you shouldn't say that out loud
there's no way i could get that guy
 he is absolutely gorgeous
what do you think you are
 that's the litterbox
 that's where the
what language are they singing in
 is that german
 i do want people cloning me
 unless god came to me in a dream and said
 you need to clone yourself so that you can live again and save the world"
 then i will
 i do want people cloning me
 because if you get cloned you know you have to relive all your same problems and stuff
 isn't that how cloning works
 cloning is stupid
 cloning is stupid
 why haven't they been working on a cure for aids or breast cancer
 they just want to make everyone die so they can clone them
 that horse is peeing
that is a of pee
 you want to push me out the window
 but unfortunately you won't fit
has anyone in this room been convicted of a felony
 come up to the front desk
 i'm going to go up there
 i'm all done
 i told you you should've murdered someone
 you'd be out too
we can't have sex until we get married
sex is a form of marriage
but we're not ready to get married
 this bitch is kicking our asses
you just used four different curse words in one sentence 
so this is the man you want to marry
and you said there were many maggots on the turkey
my dog is so racist
 she is scared of black people
 but she also hates the black people of dogs
what does that even mean
 can you spare 20 cents
 but that's my final offer
can you spare a hundred bucks
what the hell am i going to do with a quarter
y'know what i'd do if i was rich
buy a big mac
but you already have a big mac
 this is all theatrical
 i only have a dollar
can you spare some change
got any spare change
 i take dollars too
 give me your phone
 we can discuss it later
can you spare some money
 i don't have any change
 i take dollar bills
 no credit cards or checks
so i was making a roast
 but the thing was that i only had chicken stock gravy
 chicken stock gravy
 so i it
 on the beef
you live on the edge
our biggest problem with sex was that he came too fast
 because he was so into me
 so now he uses desensitizing condoms
 and that works a lot better
 especially because it takes me a really long time to have an orgasm with him
i was really anxious
 so i went to my gp and she prescribed klonopin
 that completely took my anxiety away
 but then my doctor said that she didn't feel that that was a good long-term drug
 i guess i agree with that
 i did take one klonopin on the plane yesterday
 but that was okay because it was just a recreational klonopin
now that i'm a wife i thought i should be more proper
 but it turns out he likes me slutty
i think the most passionate sex i will ever have will be during some really passionate adulterous affair
 i would have to make a really conscious decision not to have an affair; it would be like fourth-order cognition
 so you're on law & order 
 i don't watch the show
 but my son and daughter do
 what's your name
 i'll have to tell them i saw you
 maybe i should write this down
 i'm sure i'll forget
if i had a dollar for every time i saw her blowing a guy
you'd have a lot of dollars
 there's sales tax when you register a car
 ther'e sales tax
 you can't buy nuthin' without payin' no sales tax
 this is the first car i've ever bought
 didn't i already
 we ain't got no installment plan
i need some money to buy food
 please help a brother out with any change you have
 you were just in here
 all homeless people don't look the same
but you all dress the same
 the special olympics
 olympics for the retarded people
you mean the wheelchair people that fight with each other
so you're still writing songs and performing
and you're also acting
 and modeling too
which would you say you're most passionate about
i guess i'd have to say the modeling
you've had the greatest sex with me
 if a girl's bathroom is dirty
 that means that
 i have a clean bathroom
 i'd be surprised if you said you have a dirty bathroom
you dropped your glove
that's how they caught o
you might wanna rethink this all-you-can-drink sunday buffet
 my ears hurt
that's your third strike
 i said stop
i will kill you right now
 don't tell me that didn't hurt
jesus is the answer
 come to jesus and he'll hold you in his arms
 come home to jesus
 just so you know
 the rest of us all think you're fucking nuts 
you know what's really gross
 seeing the rats that get run over by the subway cars
 they're all split open and stuff
this one time i saw a rat get washed up on the shore
 he was missing all his skin
did he look happy
 block the door with your foot for a minute
go down those stairs over there
 and the track is on your left
 on your left
 i wish i had your job
you couldn't handle my job
you got more teeth than me
 i got six
 but three of them are broken
you got six and a half
 i need to go to nutley
 i know that the 192 bus goes
don't make yourself too comfortable
do you all have a financial planner
 i think it's very important
i didn't go to harvard business school just to let some guy from cornell manage my money
i hate taking subways
 they're so gross
 so many dirty
 and it's so expensive
 $2 is a lot of money
 if you can find someone else to cart your ass around this city for $2
 be my guest
i have the best blind date story ever
my sister's friend flew from australia to la for a blind date
 and she ended up flying to aruba with the guy and marrying him like a week later
but i think she was just
 35 and desperate to get married
you can't do that
 this is a passenger train
the blood of jesus christ
 you can't do that; this is a passenger train
 you need to find jesus
that is the devil's drink
 by the blood of jesus you need to repent
 i am the devil
you can't do that on a passenger train
 if i see a police i will have you arrested
you wanna borrow my cell phone
i just geeked out my profile by a million percent
 what do you think
 let me check
so what do you think
 that evangelion child shit is weird
do you have any matches
can i see id
you need id for matches
 for just matches
i can't give you matches without id
what the fuck is this world coming to
 but you don't have matches
 that don't make sense
" we sell lighters
 i ain't paying for peak hours
i can hide in the bathroom
or you can flash him
so my mom is all depressed because of the hurricane katrina stuff
 and she says she has no time to take care of herself
 and i say
 "it's just a call to duty
 if she'd go to the beauty parlor
the beauty parlor probably got destroyed
 and they had to build a new one
 and i say
 if she just goes in there and has them
she'll feel so much better
 my feet hurt and i'm cold
why don't you shut the fuck up and walk
 i want to go the fuck home
i heard that's a spoof on a cooking show
 is it about julia child
 my professor started talking about the diary of anne frank 
 i used to love her
 i had the diary
 the notebooks and the pencils and everything
i think she means lisa frank
did you bring your book
oh good; that way we don't have to talk
 when you say "crazy" i'm thinkin' 
 like smashing-car-windows crazy
i know he's crazy
 so you should be able to be like
but i'm used to his level of craziness
 the spelling bee--
was one of the kids indian
 there was an indian kid and a white kid
 my parents entered me in a spelling bee and i was fucking horrible
 there were those two kids and i just wanted to throw playstations at them and yell
 "i'm setting you free
 i'm setting you free
 where does this train go to
you ever just have one of those days 
i'm having a whole week
 i swear to god
 and i just walked here from
and now i can't even find my makeup
 i swear to god
 if they don't have it
 i'm gonna fucking
i'll fucking kill a tourist
 i hope it's not me

 she's probably taking off her pants right now
 for a vegetarian you sure have a lot of man meat
and what is wrong with having a threesome with an asian 
 and then so did i
french girls will just come up to your apartment and get naked fast
i was pulling boys in closets six months ago to make out with them
 that's what happens to horny girls who don't get the kind of attention they need
 you call me back

the phantom of the opera 
 are you kidding
 that cast is so white it makes you want to puke
 they are so lily white it makes me sick
i just don't get it
 how can you be infatuated with me when you don't even know me
he won't marry her
 but they'll probably get engaged
i finally figured out why i take solace in so many other men
 they have been my refuge and it's because i love him so much
in all this time you've only had three things to talk about
 and they were all things that i told you
i woke up and i looked down and there were bite marks all over my boobs and i had a wicked bad hangover
 then i rolled over
 kissed the guy on the forehead
 "thanks for the orgasm" and then just left 'cause i was totally having my mattress delivered that day
my favorite part of the game is when i get to kill

 what you lookin' at 
and it was just in time
 my wife was going to kill my father
 i mean just kill him
did you know if they found out who tried to blow up that starbucks
 i'm at the movies
i'm in the fucking theater
i don't care if she needs brain surgery

my baby's so low she can help me walk up steps
 you know what i am saying
 it's not my fault he signed the birth certificate
 you mean they ran out of fetuses
 the doctor said she's only 36 weeks pregnant
 but the baby is at 40 weeks
 she could drop that thing right quick
when my son was born he was very hairy
 so i had terrible heartburn
 you can't be doin' that shit
 pampers are intense
i heard on cnn today that this woman in france just received the first successful face transplant after she was mauled by her labrador
 they replaced like her whole nose and lips and chin or something

 i was just holding on
 "sex is a very beautiful thing
 you shouldn't be ashamed about it
sex is a beautiful thing
 your parents had sex
or you were adopted

so i was watching vh1 and it was a show about child stars
 jodie foster was a child star
 she was a child prostitute at like
 and they made a movie about it and everything
 they're ranking condoms
 then regular trojans
 then trojan ultra sheer
 then durex regular
 and then lifestyle ultra-sensitive
 trojan ultra sheers
but durex has at least one more that should go in there
 durex has a magnum too and it's really good
 what's their deal
 it' all about how well they endure
 not how much pleasure they give
 fucking government chart
 i'm definitely thinkin' about havin' my kids in a foreign country

nigga can tell a dishonest nigga by how eloquent he is
 if a nigga ain't eloquent
 it means he don't know how to bullshit
 eloquent nigga knows how to bullshit

 always trust a nigga who ain't eloquent
you can't be sounding smart like that
 girls ain't into niggas who talk smart and shit
 they into dumb niggas these days
 teen boy #2: i wonder why
 maybe they just into their personality and
why all these niggas always callin' people niggas all the time

 the cell phone is a public nuisance
 the white man comes in with his technology and makes a mess of the world
 i don't wanna hear about your friend
 i don't wanna know your friend
 i don't wanna know you
 why do i got to hear about your friend
 and where you're gonna meet your friend
 let me tell you something
 white man done took over the world
 back in the days black man ruled the world and called his name pharaoh
 keep up the good work
 i love black people
 but here's what i'm trying to say
 the sun is our commodity
 the white man
 they from europe
 you can't farm in europe
 it's too cold
 so we them how to farm
 and what did they do
 they mastered that shit with machines
 you see what i'm trying to say
 the white man
 what he did is he compromised our manhood with that slavery shit
 you see what i'm trying to say
 i see more uncle toms every day than i do black
i'm gonna knock you motherfuckers out
 i'm fuckin' itching to knock a white motherfucker out
you know why we ain't git no respect
 "we shall overcome"
 slogan should have been "we shall kick yo ass 
" we'd be gettin some respect today
 i fuckin' swear it's always those fucking niggers
 they are the ones raping and killing our white little girls
 i fucking swear
 put a fucking white girl in the south bronx and you fuckin' see what the fuck they do to that girl's body
he just sucks so bad
all black people suck
i don't wanna sit next to white people
 you have nothing to be afraid of
 we are only three black men
 we cannot hurt all of you
i couldn't believe that shit
 black people are such stereotypas
 what an asshole
you have to be careful
 i know what problem is
 it is all the black people
 just look at these black people
 look at the street
 all black 
 it just keeps getting worse
 more are coming
 i wanna make homemade caramel apples
they're called black people
who's that over there
 he sure is fat
kind of looks like dad the time he put that towel over his head
how much for a ride
this is the last time i'm going to tell you
 get off this street with this horse
 if i see you one more time on this street i'm taking the horse and i'm locking you up
 you hear me
 i'll take this horse and i'll lock you up
so how did your trial go
 it went my way
 the guy was actually nice; well
 he was listed as a violent felon
a nice violent felon
 he tried to play the "my 88 year old dad and my wife and kids are here
 i'm in rehab trying to clean up my life" card
 but i put him on the stand for the whole day and caught him in all these lies
i can't believe she's in love with a guy who's 26
 my dad couldn't say anything if i went out with a guy who's 28 even
 'cause he married someone like 20 years younger than him
 is she a hottie
 so she can't be
so i used to buy my drugs from a guy who would keep them in his prosthetic leg
you mean his stump
 didn't that freak you out
 having his stump all on your blow
so how was it
 so it was bitchtastic
 i like that one
 it was bitchtastic
 i just realized someone might hear us
i just pissed myself
 i pissed myself and i stink
i don't smell nothing
not as screwed as me
what do you mean
i can't figure out whose freaking hand is down my pants
i should have known you had that one
 i have every barbra streisand recording ever
i shouldn't have gotten that for you; it was such a stupid gift
 i'll just sell the old one on ebay
 i'll buy you a blt
 how 'bout that
 i see you eat a blt every day
this remake of king kong was a good movie; did you ever see the
 i didn't know it was a true story
 i'm going to church tomorrow
say hi to jesus for me
 you're not going
i stopped going when the priest stopped telling dirty jokes
i'm sure all of you have seen a photo of babe ruth and would be able to recognize him
 his autograph is worth almost as much as abraham lincoln's is
i don't know what a babe ruth is
 he's a famous baby
 please step into the back of the store
don't make this harder on yourself
they do make it harder on themselves
 i don't know which way to turn
i can't even figure out how to get the fuck out of here
try the big ass door labeled "exit
 what should i get
 the gombee burger sounds good
 that kinda sounds like gandhi
except he probably wouldn't want to eat the burger
 remember that time he was on that hunger strike
 sacred to hindus or something
 that's probably why he wouldn't have wanted to eat it
my friends told me that you told them that i'd hijacked you
 we've only dated for a week
 for so many reasons it's not going to work out
i don't understand how someone can just say it's not going to work out
 you know everything about me: my family
 all about me
 i shared everything this week
 i would have held back if i'd known
it's like i have sticker shock
you are just a much more fun
 engaged person than me
i don't understand someone who can just say it's not going to work out
 how can you just say it's not going to work out
can't we be friends
 that's why i asked you to meet me here
 at least we slept together this week
 i never wait
 i'm so glad we didn't wait
 what are those people doing
 is that fake blood
i think they're representing chinese torture or something
 have you ever read the catcher in the rye 
do you know where the ducks go in the winter
 the ones in central park; do you know where they fly to
 they just go to the duck house
they should have a test for eveyone coming out of high school to weed out the stupid kids from the gene pool
 if you don't pass
 like how momma hamsters eat their babies when they know they won't make it in the real world
 where you live
up by the fat albert store
 i used to live right near there
 that's the hospital that i went to when i had the hepatitis
 yo for real though
 that shit hurts
 i was peeing so much
 it just kept coming
 so like i was like sitting there all last period peeing
 you should go to a doctor
 i just kept peeing
the kid next to you is recording this on his cell phone
 there's a spider in my salad
 that's not a spider
 it's either a spider or four pubic hairs tied together in a knot
 neither of which i am willing to consume
she once said to me
 "i was thinking about us kissing in the shower
i hope you were wearing clothes
does she even shower
that's what i asked him
 but then he said
 "not only does she shower
 but then she licks my ass and jacks me off
 it's fucking great
 i haven't bathed since eleven
did you hear that the dude who shot the pope got let go from jail
 and the pope forgave him and everything
 i totally want to shoot the pope now
 he'd probably be cool with it
she's not a slave
slaves have a third grade reading level
 is this the same as roosevelt avenue
you don't want to get off here
 roosevelt avenue is later
 i hear new yorkers are mean but so far i've only met nice ones
we were in the middle of having sex
 and i was screaming
" he looked down at me and replied
 "there is no god
 i am your god
it sucks because since then i haven't been able to sleep with atheists
 you're not an atheist
it was about the time when i stopped going to the pediatrician and started going to the--
your kid actually wants to go to the doctor
 he can't stop thinkin' about 'em
 he can't stop thinking about boobs
where are all the violent toys
does he like trucks
 there's no violent toys; this store is too good
i'll talk to the manager about that
it's so cold in here
it's really not so bad
 not all of us have a protective layer of blubber to keep us warm in the winter
so this hooker comes up to us
 both of us
 and offers us a menage a trois
i once visited that museum
my ipod called me a homo this morning
i had it on shuffle and it played a nonstop string of 
 donna summer and
 best of all
 annie: the musical 
 "best of all
" that's amazingly gay
she gave him an ipod
 can you believe it
 just not cool for a to give a an ipod
 a guy can give a girl an ipod
 but it shouldn't happen the other way around
 it's just not right
we're going to 8th avenue
 i bet you would usually be listening to your ipod on the subway instead of talking to a group of pretty women
 never go above 14th street
 i stay within a five block radius of my apartment
i read about that store before
 maybe i'll buy some blang to go with my new bag
 i can wear it tonight when we go to the production
that pocketbook is just so you
i feel like i'm looking into a sea of prada
the plane is about to land
 please everyone turn off your ipods
why does she just assume we all have ipods
 even the people asking for money have ipods
 you got one of those ipod nanos
 i didn't pay for it
 i'm a 
can you spare some change
 i just spend my last penny on this ipod nano
this one time in madison i was drunk
i was trying to get this sorority girl to come home with me and she said she would if i got rid of her ex-boyfriend (he was hanging out with us
) that's all i remember from that night
 i woke up the next morning
 with a pulled groin muscle and scrapes all over my knees and elbows
what the fuck 
 i had to ask around to find out what happened
 fell in the lake in madison--i pulled my groin muscle there--then i pulled myself out and crawled home on hands and knees since i couldn't walk
 i have been blowing out the biggest boogers in the mornings
 i been blowin' moons
 like the moons of jupiter
either someone farted or it's terrorism
 you dropped some change
 aren't you gonna pick that up
they're all facing tails
what's the name of that group
death cab for cutie
death camp for cutie
what a horrible name
this is them playing
 do you like it
yeah i love it
 but what a horrible name
 can you reach into my backpack and hand my my wig and the zoloft
of he's going to call me again
 i bought him drugs
 there goes my hash connection
i need my valtrex
drugs don't kill people; umbrellas kill people
i keep waiting for them to come up with one named
" for people who want extra sex
 i'm so high right now
 i'd dance to the sound of two tin cans being dragged behind a car
there is no smoking on this bus
 that includes cigarettes
 she's your mother
it's about an old depressed cat and her friends put her in a tire and shoot her to heaven
i want to offend animal rights activists by wearing endangered jeans
 a human ass can take a horse
 your dog looks like a gremlin
 from the movie
 the movie 
 your dog looks like a gremlin
 the cute gremlin
 gorilla ripped that nigga's tongue out with his 
 when they're outside
 you call it a rat
 but in your house
 you call it a mouse
i know a lot of people who hate the brontosaurus stampede because they think it's too
i think die fledermaus the bat
because crows don't live in antarctica
 they don't 
i don't want to visit my miserable family unless it's for a funeral
sorry it took me so long; i had to move
 that lady smelled
 like an old person
 she smelled like my grandmother right before she died
 i could never be a dead person
unless i was actually dead
do not touch any of these people; they'll pull out a gun and shoot you
i'm not writing; i'm my memoirs
 and after i'm done with that
 i'll probably go and do something
 kill my mother
 she deserves it
 there was the human sacrifice
 human sacrifice with red bouncing balls
 i just want to make sure he doesn't kill you
one time when i was dance-walking
 i ran into a dead guy
they were all fighting over us
 who would get us if my parents died
 and my godparents won
he's just lucky you don't hire an assassin and take care of it
if he were alive and female and cool i'd go out with him
no one is gonna kill somebody for five dollars
you must've done some to get shot in church
and then my dad stabbed him
 and that's when it all went to shit
 it's a true story
i really hate the concept of starbucks
 but they really have the best product
do you guys want food or sushi
 did you know there is no pudding in kid jail
 you're a cool guy; you have wavy hair
 you chew gum
what do you want 
 do you want some soup 
 you have a noodle on your chin
and shrimp is round
 not a color
 i'm going home
i hate when people swallow their gum
 my mom does that
 when you swallow your gum
 it gets stuck in your heart
 i love ice cream
 my mouth's watering just thinking about it
i hope your finger isn't in my food
has your poop ever been orange
 yesterday my poop was orange
 today it's back to brown
 but yesterday it was orange
 i'm never eating clam chowder again

 so sally's having some "bagel brunch" thing at her place
 but why the fuck would i want to go eat carbohydrates with a bunch of people i don't even like
what happens to the leaves if you just leave them on the ground
 they just die
 isn't that just a place in iraq
where the hell is the damn ice skating rink
 somebody tell me
 i know you know
i'm going to have to think about this because when i don't i never have any plans
does anybody speak the language from china
do these stairs work
and what the is this "knowledge is power" thing
i have a simple question
 but it's kinda complicated
you got a minute
do you see that woman who talks on the radio
 it's the da vinci game
 you could find out the secret of christmas from this
since when do you have a fatwa against tom hanks
i just found out what coke is
when people describe themselves of having an "olive skin tone" does that mean they are green
 so during the american revolution
 the americans wanted independence because they wanted to be free
one of the ways i learn about the world is through the sense receptors on my tongue
 what am i supposed to do with a gross of used condoms

 what station is that
 i'm gonna smoke some crack there
 but none of us respect alex
 because he's a retard
when will you quit taking pictures
 this is the stupidest thing ever
 all that stuff i did before doesn't even seem stupid anymore
you cannot possibly understand
and it's not 'cause you're stupid
 which you're not 
because you have no estrogen
you could not possibly understand what chocolate means to a woman
and if you have any problems figuring out the touch screen entertainment center
 we'll try and find the nearest 7 year old to help you
i couldn't watch it again
 it was so redundant
i don't make fun of people who were born retarded
 i make fun of people who were born

when i was younger i used to sing my loins out in the shower
i might as well put pom poms on my ass
 sparklers in my ears
 and sing i will survive 
 if you're a terrorist and you wanna get into a building
 you should just say you're from price waterhouse or ernst & young
 nobody asks any questions
today i recommended the woman i interviewed for an associate position based solely on the fact that she was attractive
you get in trouble for doing your job
 you get in trouble
so i told him
 "you might not be working on the work that you've been working on
 but you're definitely going to be working on work
i would never leave anything to anyone not in my life
 anything i make
 i leave to my wife--i'm not married yet--but i'd leave everything to my wife and my kids
 i don't got much right now
 but i got a plan
 anyone who's not successful
 it's because they don't have a plan
 if you don't have a plan
 you'll fall down
 those guys have their own airplanes and helicopters because they had a plan
 that's what i'm working on now

 i don't know
 like that song
 that's what people think
 but ironic is when you say some shit but you mean some other shit
how the fuck should i know
 you the nigga with the ged
i still don't understand why they say "word
 i think it's because they don't know what word to use
 they get so excited they can't say anything else
why don't they just say like
 that's awesome" or something
that just makes you sound like an idiot
 why did his legs pop up like that
 chocolate chocolate chip muffin
 that's a little revisionist
 don't you think
give me some of the cheese
 i don't worry about no gym so you can put more than that on
 i can tell you don't love that cheese
 i can make a pork chop taste like chicken
 you want a coupon for a spicy chicken
 it comes with free fries
 you know you want free fries
 it's good for your aura
i cannot stand americans who come to the opera smelling like hamburgers
 it so smells like fucking chocolate in here
health issues and drama at school and home
 it's like a pizza pie of misery
 this is like russia in the 19th century only instead of toilet paper and soap
 people are lined up to buy brie and pate
i was just hoping they would let me eat it while i got a lap dance
we're moving on to outer space--which is
 i remember when my hair used to smell like special sauce
i don't think it's time yet to do the professional intervention thing
 i mean if she drops down below 90
 then maybe it's time
 but i'd like to her get down to 95
 then she would be hot
 as long as she doesn't lose those 5 in her tits
 she has nice tits
 i thought of a new michael j
 you go into a verizon and start shaking and they go
 "who do you think you are
" and you say
 'cause you're michael j
'cause he has parkinson's
 so i gave you herpes
 now we have herpes
 cancer cures smoking
 think about it
i coughed it up and everything was better
 jaundice is so in now
so she's still smoking in your apartment
 and she knows you're allergic
 you should tell her that for every cigarette she smokes during the day
 you'll put one out on her while she sleeps
see this weird thing that showed up on my leg in africa
 kind of looks like ringworm
i've been using paper towel to blow my nose and now it's all chapped
 like my ass
i want to get a tattoo on my wrist that says
 "take your vitamins" so i'll remember to take my vitamins and won't feel like shit like i always do
i used to catheterize people all the time
 and i mean 
 tons and tons of times
 for a hundred dollars
 you can get that old mink stole
 i hate it when guys like
 ride the train without their shirt on and stuff
you can put sneakers in the oven
 but that don't make them biscuits
 but he was obviously doing it so his shirt would ride up so he could show off how much weight he'd lost
 and i was like
 that's not coming anywhere near area
people react differently to me in a suit
 it's like they sense that it's who i really am
 the sherlock holmes of underwear
then the models come in on drugs
 still in their outfits
 and people are yelling
 " what did they take 
" that's what my fashion week is like
 are you in stupid mode
you're having a senior moment
i wanna go see that underwear
american apparel makes me want to fucking kill myself
are they nice ties
 are they the nicest ties i have ever seen
 look at her legs
 it's beyond cottage cheese thighs
 her whole legs are cottage cheese
 it looks like she poured herself into her pantyhose
i have been a bartender and a waiter but i have never been the host
 there is no way to estimate how long it will take to fit someone's breast into a bra
 this is an art
 not a science
i'm surprise i haven't seen nobody wearing shorts
 there is something to be said for dressing seasonally
 it's cool if you want to wear a tube top to the bar or whatever
 but when girls are going out in these little tube tops
 wear a jacket
 no outfit is cool unless you're comfortable in it
 to a degree
 won't somebody please buy me a pair of dungarees
 i really need some dungarees
 you look like either a nurse or a maid
 i can't tell if you're serving drinks or starting an iv
 i used to get so high and den turn on dat spanish channel so loud and just sit in front of it and listen
he got high on furniture
so you don't want to try the marijuana
but you came all the way from japan for the marijuana
 now you don't even want to try it
forest view rehab 
motherfucker called me a drug dealer
 and i got 
 i slammed him up against the fucking wall 
 i smoke pot 
 i'm not a drug dealer
 don't label me
and i was like
 i was totally a speed freak in college; i think i can handle theraflu day
i am so glad we do drugs
but i took ecstasy by accident
 i was 43 years old
 it's kind of harmless; it's cute
 it's got a butterfly on it
 you were never a fuck machine
 and i certainly did know how to fake it
 i'm tired of this shit
 i ain't fuckin' no girl behind no nigga's back
at least not that i know of
but you were disappointed that you didn't get molested
 that was a joke
 you are sexually repressed
 lost my virginity three times in that pillow fight
so is this like a regular orgy
 or do i need to bring a sleeping bag
is that fucking ted
 in the same fucking position we left him in three hours ago
you gotta get to know me before you find out i'm a slut
i feel bad for her
 because what if she really isn't a slut
 what if she's just
so then his mom walks in and i swear to god he's buttnaked from like the waist down
 so he grabs this pillow
 and she looks over to the bed and we're all under the covers
 and you can see like
 half my back without my shirt on and she looks back at him with the pillow and then at all of us again and goes
 "you're all naked under there
i was supposed to be at work at 6:30 but i fell asleep on the train so since i'm late i said
 i'm gonna get some mcdonalds
it's because he was trying to fuck me while i slept last night
i didn't sleep for four nights and he's trying to fuck me while i'm sleeping
he should have been happy
 i gave it to him twice last night
and once each to two of his friends
you know i'm a stripper and a model too
what do you do to top double-teaming
 fuck a corpse
 he would go over to her house and she'd be doing two guys at once
 we'll fuck the fucker and we'll fuck him summarily
 and one time he asked me if we could just fuck without kissing
 i think i'm man enough for three women
i'd let him fuck my sister
 he's a good guy
i wanna see you
 i wanna feel you
 i wanna feel you inside me
 and suck on those titties
 i don't snatch purses
 i don't bother women
 but don't get me wrong
 i'm not a homosexual
 but i do bathe
 and i do sleep on the subway 'cause i am a bum
anybody want to take the day off and cuddle with me
i'm just tryin' to get some pussy here and all y'all gotta come up in here and bother me
i've been shitting plastic lately
i need money to buy popcorn
i need a hot meal
i need money to buy popcorn
 you make a big doo-doo
 i make big doo-doos too
spare a little change
 that's all right
the tax man has a licence to kill
 no questions asked
 more people should know that
if you see a suspicious black package on this train do not pick it up 
 if you see a large
 black package on my seat after i leave
 it is not a bomb 
 i've been riding this train for fifteen years
 leave it for the coney island clean-up crew
 they'll take care of it
 it is not a weapon
 it is not filled with hundred dollar bills
 just don't it
did you know that union square is a hundred years older than times square
 sorry for the interruption
 i am trying to raise one million dollars and 25 cents for wine research
all you people who just got on the train
 everybody in this car already gave me $7
 everybody gave me $7 but you
so i saw this homeless guy walking down the street with
 all the bags and stuff
 and he had something bewtween his 
 help an ugly dude out
 let's get this train moving
 there's people gots to go to work
 gots to go to school
 there's pregnant people
 a couple of jewish lawyers out to fuck the world
when i told her i worked for the state of new york she seemed to
i will never pay for the new york times 
 you remember what they did
 printing our home address and pictures of mommy and us half nude 
 i will never pay for the new york times 
 remember how mommy got letters from convicts
 because they're the only ones who have enough time to read the entire new york times 
 mommy will never give them a dime
 they're lucky i didn't sue
 all they want to do is stay in my apartment and order delivery
 they're from the suburbs and don't have delivery there
i thought this was the ghetto
 but i haven't seen
 a single black person
 this train station is very crowded
 that is why they call it grand central station
 so this is where it to be
 the down escalator is so much easier than the up one
 i like the natural history museum
 but i'd like it better if there were whores all around it
i couldn't ever take the train into work and have to deal with all the people
 the trains are dirty
 and takes a long time to get anywhere
 that's the beauty of living in new york; you don't have to deal with those things
so i was down on canal
 buying some of that perfume my wife likes for valentine's
 some of that chanel; usually it's $45 a bottle
 but i talked this guy down to $25
 i got it home
 but before i give it to my wife
 i spray a little on my hand--and it smells exactly like roach spray
 go back to the suburbs
 how old will i be when i have sex
i tell every nigga i meet that i have four kids
 and if they still want to holla
 then that's more money for me
so now she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father of the little bastard is
 more people are getting in
 what the hell
 maybe the father is on this elevator too
and i hate seeing the little children suffering
 that's the other thing i hate about winter
i used to like it when i was a child
 but then i was molested
 did you all know that osama bin laden was one of about 50 children
 that could actually explain some things about him
 not getting enough attention as a child
 maybe if he had been one of three instead
 we wouldn't have so many problems
please don't repeat this to anyone
 all i'm saying is that
 she want to be with me
 she gots to get rid of them kids
 i ain't playing with no kids
people steal children out of this place every single day of the year
you ever notice how all the kids who walk to school smoke
 they are all thin and smoking
 and the lazy little brats who ride the bus are chubby with their legs all over each other
you are lucky you are not a kid
 i would beat your ass
stop calling him a nino
 he got hair on his balls
every time todd talks to a girl he thinks he's on a date
make out with your boyfriend for me this weekend
 i just made up such a good joke
 how do you know you're dating the dumbest bitch in the world
 she points to the other side of the street and says
 "why are they whispering
 but they're not whispering
 you just can't hear them 'cause they're far away
 dumb fuckin' bitch
 what do you want to do later
 how about we watch porn
 and then go to the planetarium
 in that order
 i put the bitch through law school
 and then she tells me--and i 
 "i don't need you anymore
" i found her at our safe deposit box
 trying to empty everything and take it with her
 there are no normal women in this city left to date
 sorry for my language
let me put it this way: i didn't want to be hooking up with him i was hooking up with him
 and then i got stuck
but i remember you
 you spent the night at my house
he was really hot
 i got his number but i'm not going to call him for at least 3 days
it was an okay date
 but we just talked about our cats
 and i was like
 " isn't sexy
 i'm having dinner with him tonight
he didn't say anything about handcuffs
 he cooked dinner for me
 "finally a good nice sensitive guy
" until this lolita shows up in the living room
 i'm here for the weekend
i can either have a dog or a girlfriend
 i can't afford both
 the red is looking really good on you
 that's gonna be the next color of my living room walls
 like god had a nosebleed
take a black man home
 surprise your family
saturday was a day from hell
 i have no recollection of saturday
 because that was the day my dad said i had to choose
between a cherokee and a renegade
 the cherokee was white
 and the renegade was green
 and they had
 completely different features
 i chose the cherokee
 and for that i blame my mom
 because i think she pressured me into taking a car i didn't really want
 when what i wanted was the best features of both of them in one vehicle
my favorite color is green
it looks like trees
imagine if you were black
 wouldn't you feel invisible
 do we have to wear bright red underwear to his birthday party again this year
i didn't want to take the bus because it takes forever
 but i also didn't see a train coming from the black hole
she must have been white because if she was puerto rican
 she would have slapped me
you already black; just go out at night
i feel like if your vagina is wet enough
 you won't get aids
 this is a design
 cunts designed this
 cunts and no one else
you know i was thinking
 if you ever wanted to like take some weed on vacation
 you could just like make a fake tampon and
you know where i'm going with that one
 what are we gonna give him
 i think i've licked my last cunt
 let's see where you're going with this
last night i had a dream i was eating my brother's pussy
do you believe she goes all the way to queens to get her crotch waxed
this guy eats me out so much he must think my name is meatball
i'm going to be the oldest person to ever have a sex change on 8th avenue
 if it ain't a brand name
 i don't stick it in my cooter
 this is perfect for when it's cold out and this in here is for when you finger me
 the other day she said
 "i want you to fuck me in the park
" so we went to the park
 went behind some bushes where there was a clearing and bam
 then i came on her face
he ain't licking my forehead
 he can lick your forehead all you want
 i recognized that huge forehead from a mile away
so i said to him
 "okay don't put it in my mouth
 put it in my face
remember when i threw cum in greg's face
 he got so pissed
hold on one second
 i'm getting exfoliated
 how about i staple my balls to your forehead
 i really can't believe it
 she has a face like pavement
i really want a blowjob
 i mean nosejob
 i don't know where that came from
what's the "n word
i'm not gonna tell you
it's worse than all the other words because it makes specific people feel bad
you don't need to know it
 it's one of those things you'll learn when you get older
 you'll learn a lot of bad things when you get older
you know where i wanna go
 have you heard of it
 it's in new jersey
 you know where i wanna go
 that genghis khan guy
it's weird you're never horny
i just feel like sex is like bowling
 i enjoy bowling but i'm never like
 i haven't bowled in long" or "it's friday night
 i have to go bowling
maybe you haven't found the right bowling partner
bowling is something that really isn't improved by doing it with someone else
 i've bowling but i could go the rest of my life without doing it again
 i know i'll have sex again
 but i could give a rat's ass
 have you ever heard anyone say "i need to bowl real bad "
and she just lets him in
 and he comes over
 and she opens the door for him
 so we're alone
 and he comes and
 crawls into bed with me
and i sleep naked
 what the fuck
you should fire her as a roommate
 it sort of turned out all right
have you seen charlie
he said he was gonna check himself into the hospital
 and probably stay for a long time
because i have some food for him
 have you seen charlie
 i have some food for him
charlie done checked hisself into the psycho ward for two months
i guess i gotta throw the food out then
i think they should make a sequel to death of a salesman 
so you never finished telling me that story about whatshisname
come over here and tell me while i dookie
 don't act like i don't tell you shit while you're on the toilet
 a famous artist
 you don't see a lot of his work anymore
 'cause he's dead
last night my girlfriend called me caligula
 'cause he was crazy and evil
 why did she call you caligula
 i guess i could understand if she was talking about his big cock
communism is like anarchism
 everyone owns everything
 no one owns anything in anarchism
how are you not dead already
so she told me
 "i think simon de beauvoir was so brave for a man
 to write like that
" can you believe it
how can she get a phd without knowing who simone de beauvoir was
so then why are guys from the eastern europe and black guys so good at basketball
they've had to fight to survive
 it weeds out the physically inadequate
give me a break
 it's the ghetto
 not some hobbesian state of nature; they're not cavemen living in anarchy up there
i was selling some stuff on ebay
 but got scared
because they kept asking too many questions
they wanted to know if the louis vuitton bag and belt i was selling was real
 it freaked me out
i ended the sale
 because i had two people watching me and i got scared
 they can watch to see who bids and how much they bid and then they can try to make a last minute bid
 but why didn't you sell the stuff
i was scared and this guy kept asking me to send pictures
with that hat and beard you look like a jewish rabbi
 it's not cool to make fun of people who jewish
so how many tombstones do we have
 so we got the client
 the cpa and the attorney
we gotta figure out how to get one more person involved
what do you like
 what do you like 
to change with the times
 i guess as opposed to conservative rock
there is a conservative rock
do you know what the word "ontological" means
i have seen it before
is it like an orange
 it's something weird like that
i know what you mean
 how much are these
 or two for 18
 on macdougal they sell them cheaper
 but they're made by chinese kids who make one-fifty an hour
 are you going to be here tomorrow
 tomorrow it's going to rain
 and then for the next fifteen days the government is paying me to take ecstasy and play on the computer while they observe me
 maybe you should buy both; keep the large one and find someone to give the small one to
 who do i know that needs a statue of liberty
so why didn't you come to dinner
i don't like you
so i decided to celebrate turning 50 by traveling to tibet
 it's near china and russia
 it's not like i don't like to travel but i went to mexico once and it was stupid
 i'm from spain so i guess we're all from europe
spain isn't in europe
 yes it is
 europe is like its own continent
i was talking about europe the country
 not that little
where the fuck is park avenue
 what is going on 
 what the fuck
 where the fuck is park avenue 
if you just take a right at the next street and keep going
 you'll hit it
i don't fucking care
 if i had a gun i'd fucking shoot you
 i'm taking these off
 let me see 'em
 they make my butt look like a white person's ass
they make my ass look flat like a white person's 
 i can't hear you
can you spare some change
 where you going
 fucking buckingham palace
i hope we see one of the olsen twins
 they were so cute on that show
those kids were disgusting
 they weren't cute
 they were hideous
 they should have put bags over their heads
 you know who is a cute baby
 from the family guy 
 he wants to kill his mother and take over the world
i just don't think i'm his type
 he's very intellectual
what do you mean
he's all "yada yada yada" and i'm very "what's your favorite starburst
 you said first was the worst
 "first was the 
what the heck does that mean
i've never been above ground before
where are you going
we're in queens right now
 queens is not where you want to be
 do you have any meatloaf
 that's not meatloaf
it's almost the same
do you have any meatloaf
it's the same thing
 it all tastes the same
 i'll take three
that would be joseph
i see you will be engaged by the end of the year
so can i give you a full reading
 i got a fortune cookie in my lunch
 i hope nobody takes that out of context
takes what out of context
a thing i just thought
i was in the peace corps down there
 i didn't know that
 not the peace corps; club med
 can you tell me how to get to all those buildings over there
 you can't there from here
unless you can walk on water
that the fucking bitch that called the cops on me
 that fucking bitch called the cops
i always knew you were a bigot
i would like to
never say "notwithstanding" in new york
 too long a word for here
notwithstanding and two financial empires have already
you're making my point
 redford says "notwithstanding"
robert lives in utah
aren't you gonna wash your hands
i don't need to
 i flush with my foot
do you also wipe with your foot
i've never had venison before
 you can taste bambi
 you can taste the innocence
 and the fear
 people are still inside
i should do a head count
 i don't know how many people we started with
 can i get some money
 can't help you out
 things are tough for everyone
 can you at least get me some water from your sink
 let me find a bottle
 i have a bottle i can give you
 was this just sittin' around
 i just filled it up from my sink
 i don't mean no disrespect
 but you mind dumping this out and letting it run for a while
 shit just ain't cold enough
 has anyone ever told you you look just like that rap guy
you mean snoop dogg
 all the time
are you related to him
 he's a distant cousin
 you must get this all the time
 even my girlfriend says it
 that must be the reason she dates you
 she probably wouldn't date you if you weren't related to him
i didn't brush my tongue this morning
 i didn't have a cigarette
 i saw a sign that said
 "have you brushed your tongue today
 you just have to go to the bathroom and throw up a little and then you'll be all set
i took this class called history of the universe
 that's so intimidating
plus it's all about physics and astrology and stuff
go to the back door
let this guy on
here's to 5 inches or less
i really could take that the wrong way
i'm talking about the storm
you think anyone is gonna jump us
we're in the middle of a fucking blizzard
 who is gonna jump us
 maybe one of those snow thugs
 it's a winter freakin' wonderland
 they said on tv that it was gonna snow
 it's not snow
 it's frozen sunshine
 i've never had sex in the snow
 that's how new yorkers prepare for a blizzard
can i borrow your snow shovel
 i need to clean my car
 i just realized that this isn't my car
my pants are soaking wet from all the snow
 take them off
i'm naked on the train
what do you think of when you hear the word "bathhouse"
do you know why i can't walk on this side of you on the sidewalk
i'll laugh no matter what
'cause this is not my side of the bed
if we were laying on my bed i wouldn't be on my side
 yes you would
 if we're laying on our backs this would be your side of the bed
but i sleep on my stomach
we're walking in the street
 there is no bed
i met a guy last night
 it's not accurate to say that he had a jay leno caricature face
i really think this is the way to go
 i'm not 
 they don't even know me
 i don't want them to always think of me as "that lesbian girl
" i said no
i meant eighth avenue
so how do you want it done
i want to have the same lining and density as that cute
 little chinese girl had
it was a boy
 where you goin'
to the middle of the train
 i wanna be in the middle
but we're standing in the middle motherfucka
 the middle is at the end
some passengers found a suspicious bag
what did you do
i threw it in the garbage
 what's your vegetable special today
 let me check
 macaroni and cheese 
 sometimes i just feel like breaking down and crying
wanna get some pizza
 life can be so hard sometimes
 i really can't take it anymore
have you considered suicide
 you need to stop complaining about life or just kill yourself and get it over with
 i'm getting off at the next stop and going back home
wanna get some pizza
did you call giuliani
 call in a favor
after all you did for him after 9/11
 what a slap in the face
 is this the train that stops at that museum
 the art museum
 the other one with all the bones and dead animals
 why would you wanna go someplace like that
 what are you doing
 what do you think
 why are you putting your credit card into this box-thing
 this machine gives you money if you have a card
so i was like
 you're too small
 i don't even feel nuttin'
 he gotta be at least 10 inches for me to even consider it
did you give anything to your boyfriend for valentine's day
 i date girls
 why would you think that i go for guys
i just always thought
but you're bald too
you know who i feel really bad for
 really ugly people
i'm looking for a lipstick
 it's really pretty and it's in all the magazines
 do you know the one
 this girl was hot
 it's not even questionable
will anyone trade a quarter for fifty cents
 will anyone trade a quarter for fifty cents
you should be a model
 i what you've done with your face
i tell you there is nothing quite so beautiful as seeing the human body used as an instrument
 you can't go selling yourself short and go saying that the other girls are better than you at auditions
 if you want to go and say--i don't know---that they're prettier
 i'd go with that
 you're asshole of the year
now what she needs is a razor dildo
i'm gonna get a new dress for her from goodwill
listen to this: on thanksgiving she gave us all copies of a million little pieces 
 on christmas we all got books about alcoholism
and he'll give her a hat
 and it'll just be a big
so i called to return the gnomes
 the ones we got for the wedding
 i don't know what to buy
 because it might be
that motherfucker gave me walnuts
 at least give your secretary some lima beans or legumes
 so i can throw some neck bones in 'em and make meal out of it
 i just sent an all-staff email to everyone and told them there were treats in the kitchen
 somebody ate 'em too
it's good to like music
 that came out really bad
 the house of pain is busy getting in a fight right now
i broke my nose to this song
i'm looking for something
you should have seen the other guy i almost hooked up instead
i want to live with a group of singing nuns
 they'll go about singing how i'm difficult but they love me anyway
 and mother superior will have a great range and a vibrato like no other
willie nelson smokes pot like a rastafarian
 by the way
sing us a song you're the rich motherfucker
 sing us a song tonight
 hitler was right
 there is a lot of parking in new york
where are the trains
 they're all listening to my conversation
 this guy just helped me out
 he told me where we are
 this is awful
 i shouldn't be talking on the bus
 you don't talk on the phone on the bus
 we're probably going to go to the rocket feller center
 that wasn't a very new yorkian thing to say
new yorkers are so tall and robust because of all the roach parts they eat
 it won't mess up your hair
 this is just like great adventure
 where are all the rollercoasters
 i didn't get called back
 i'm in grand central
so i'm on canal street right now
 i think that's near chinatown
they only gave the new trains to the 6 line because it doesn't go to harlem
 they aren't going to give people new trains
i see it all the time
 people are always falling over on the subways and buses and i just laugh and laugh
bagel fumes are a siren song if ever there was one
i was fighting with this guy and his dog was in the room; that dog bit me
she said i looked like tony the tiger
 honestly i just don't give a shit about those fuckin' elephants
 but that guy
 he's about to bite into an elephant's cock
elephant picks up a lion and throws him
 lions ain't shit
 she's half maltese and half labrador
 i call her a matador
 to make fun of all those doodle breeds
 i just saw a fight with the security guard and the guy with the big dog
 you know what his dog looks like
his dog looks like a camel
 it just hangs
when they find me dead from diabetes
 it'll be worth it 'cause i'll die happy
 they won't find my body because my dog will eat me
 i think bats eat rats
 you sound like a goat
fifi didn't like ours
 so we made them switch it
 the second we walked in
 she turned away
 and i knew she wasn't having it
 isn't that right
that's not a dog
 that's a pillow on wheels
 wait a minute
 i mean that's a pillow on legs
 dogs don't have wheels
i was going to give you all a quiz today
 but then i realized that it was valentine's day
 you're supposed to do something for the people you love on valentine's day
 and of course
 i love all of you very much
i decided to give you the quiz on pink paper instead

 it could be six more months before you actually get your diploma
 it's so totally laid-back there

 "please don't throw blood on me or something
 i don't hate animals; i have a dog
not around your neck
do you have a book called white supremacy by fredrickson
can you see if any other barnes & noble has it
 none in manhattan
 i take it it's for a class or something
 it's for my own
i need a book of art or photographs by crazy people
guess who my dad saw in an elevator yesterday 
i'm pretty sure he's dead
 don't you mean johnny 
 can i get a poppy seed bagel to go
you want anything on that
 you are so beautiful
 are you interested in modeling
i love the way you walk
 down a runway
it's because my heel is broken
i can't believe i kissed both of them
i kissed both of them too
i don't even want to talk about this
so then he kissed me
 and it was really awkward
 because i don't want to get involved with that train wreck
so what did you do
told him that i really liked him
 but i was seeing someone else exclusively
 and you do 
 but being in awkward social situations makes me a compulsive liar
isn't that also your excuse for drinking too much
that's really not fair to say
so what did you do after that
we did some vodka shots
 and then i passed out on the subway and ended up in brooklyn
you still don't have any halloween candy
 it's valentine's day candy
 why do you keep calling it halloween 
you have no idea how much less anxiety i have now that i know i don't have to worry about leaving the country
not that they are kicking me out
 but you know that i can leave and come back and it's not an issue
this just makes me so excited
 when i get excited i start to twitch
 but it's a good thing
 you get me excited
 not in that way
 you're my professor
 but not to say you aren't good looking
 so let's pretend i was deaf for that last 30 seconds and i'll see you on friday
i guess i'll be taking my vibrator out for valentine's
last month i thought i was in love with you
 now i realize i'm stupid
 you were flirting with him
 i was kicking his ass
 you could have tried to move
 i didn't try to step on you
 don't you think that when someone says "excuse me" that might have a disability
 just because i bumped into you doesn't mean i want to have intercourse with you
 you're going to try and have intervourse with me
 i'm going to tell the police
 let me get your number
 so we can have intercourse
you just get crushes on everybody
 just on hot people
what did he say after you told him we hooked up last night
i said i was still in love with you and broke up with him before he could say anything
 did you tell your girlfriend yet
 what do you think
if i had to choose between vd and a girlfriend
valentine's day is so stupid
 i'm going to boycott it
 'cause it's so commercialized
and also you don't have any girlfriends
 do i know you
you look like a scarecrow standing there
 it's your smile
 it reminded me
 but i've gotta find me a real man
 gotta find him before valentine's day
so i totally did it and it didn't taste bad until
 can i get your number
i hate valentine's day
 it's so stupid
i'll buy you flowers
i just wanna have sex
that's what i meant
 i'll go down on you
 happy valentine's day

any democrat on this train who thinks hillary clinton could be president is masturbating in their mind
 all one hundred of them
you have a nice night
this train goes really fast
they don't run it as often
 i think because they're afraid people might jump in front of it
 who could be that depressed
 take some pills
 for christ's sake
i'm surprised it's such a problem here

 jesus's mom didn't fuck anyone
 she was a fuckin' virgin

 like the french revolution
 or the holocaust
 that one was pretty good
you just called me a pussy
you are what you eat
i was walking and there was a group of dominicans talking on the corner and the only reason i understood what they were saying was because i've been listening to a lot of reggaeton
they must've been talking about fucking someone
it was so funny
 i mean i was talking to the horse in english
 and the horse didn't understand a fucking word i said
it was a spanish horse
 they didn't understand english

 so many orthodox jews at the law school

 it's not like everyone else is catholic
but jews are like the opposite of catholics
 not even close
you're a slut; that's not very catholic
don't wipe your hands on me
 what's wrong with you
 megan's father only got 25 years after she went missing
 and it's not like i'm in a rush to get home to your mother

 you know what happens when you say that's stupid
you don't want 
 go look at it again and tell me what you see
 what do you see
i'm stopped at a light; i can't get much slower
the ceremony is so long
 they should just throw the diplomas off the stage into the audience
 and if you don't catch one
 you don't graduate
so then the football team will actually graduate
what would happen if i suddenly went deaf
 it would take you a while to notice
 there's something stuck on your pants
 it's toilet paper
 it can't be; i haven't gone to the bathroom in 
 i'm so glad i went out with you and not your

 my mother wasn't inattentive
 she made great meals
 she would cook these huge meals and my friends would all tell me how incredible these meals were that she cooked
 she cooked these great meals and then at night she'd blow every guy in town
 shame on you
 screw me twice
 shame on me
 screw me three times
 i'm a whore
i put the "ho" in "tough road to hoe"
so like a male prostitute hitting on you is like
the tribeca or something
 i hope it's as fantastic as doing a line off a hooker's back
i didn't pay her for the sex; i paid her to leave afterwards
a pimp is a very lucky man
what's the difference between you and a prostitute
 i just got back from 100 centre street
 georgie boy was drooling over counselor's dick

 who cares if you tell a little lie
 nigga; drank red bull
 that shit gives you wings
 you was like flyin'
there is a very fine line between stalking and making things happen
 now i've gotta go fight crime
the churro guy is not the most honest person in the world
guys just lie and lie
 they put their penis in and then they lie
if you make me come up that hill i'll be really mad 
you people are the only thing standing between
where's the yellow incense for the dead people

 it's where all the cancer is
 what's the point
i've felt so weird today
 you know when you're fifteen and really hungry
 that's how i feel
 it's just your scrotum being stapled; it's not like it's actually going to go through your testicle
i was freaking out on the floor
they were able to delay the surgery two days by shoving the intestines back through the hole
and i didn't know if it was my stomach or my appendicitis
what happened to him

 and got a handjob from her
 the thing is
 she had one hand
 she had an arm
 just no hand
 and she gave me a handjob
 with the other one
i started laughing when she started giving me a handjob
 the irony of the whole thing
 but she was real hot
i think i'm gonna try and hook up with her again and see if she'll rub my balls
 with the other one
 if you were 40 and you had only slept with five people
 i wouldn't marry you

i threw up on meryl streep's daughter
it's an ancient tradition: every chinese new year bruce lee fights chuck norris for good luck
i got so much dirt under my nails
 you'd think i was a crackhead
money is so dirty
 and yet i don't feel dirty when i touch it; i feel happy
 they already gave us the pep talk about not trashing the hotel rooms
it kinda tasted like dirty sock water
 i liked it

 i thought she had so much anxiety and that wasn't the right atmosphere to conceive
 i wrote them a song called "there's a baby on the way" and a few months later the whole family was together and they announced they were pregnant
 and i told them that i'd written a song "there's a baby on the way" and that i'd written it june 10th
 and she's like
 " 's the day we found out
" and my friends in la
 they'd been trying and i played them the song and sure enough
all he does is spend time with his wife and baby
 who would want to live like that
so you're pregnant and you don't know if it's the father
 son or son-in-law
 such a bad situation she's in

 he's the one who farts all the time
i shouldn't even pay rent in my house
 i'm out so much

you could live at the aspca
 it's a good place to live
 my ex-girlfriends live there
all our stores are in the st

you're missing the point
cashmere is god's gift to the human race
 the part of the human race that can it
 i really like arab guys
 i don't care

stop acting like a tourist
but i am a tourist
if you're embarrassed over what a ton of people you've never seen before and never will see again think
 you're never going to have any fun
 tourists are allowed to act like dorks
then why do you make fun of tourists in boston
 you have to be the most wonderful person in the world to do something like that
 but it's still a felony
i can't imagine dropping off my brother at the airport all like
 "i'm okay with never seeing you again 'cause you might die in battle
 at least he gets a whore
'cause you know they get whores in wars
what are you talking about
 world war ii
what'd that guy want
white guy wanted to know where the kangol hat store was
 must be from jersey
he wanted to eat me out
 he was like
" and i was like
i've already slept with 6 professors and it's only two weeks

 he needs to keep it hard
 you have to understand he has to drink
actually when he drinks
 his sex drive improves
 why you gotta be with that verizon
 they got no text message plan
 i ain't paying no ten dollars a month for no texting
 you gotta go with cingular
 then you don't gotta pay nothing and you get
 what the fuck
 a much bigger phone selection too and none of that extra charges bullshit
 why you gotta talk so loud
 we all don't need to hear all about your life

 just no need for you to talk so loud
 that shit is stupid
 the hell kind of name is that anyway

 the first time my boyfriend and i had sex
 it was because of golden girls 
can you do something productive and get us tickets to the maury povich show 
i know i promised
 i just felt that getting laid for the first time in almost a year was slightly more important than remembering to tivo the sopranos for you
 but do you know you're 
 i do know that
 now will you stop following me
it's british for "ten days"; like
 "i'll be gone for a fortnight
 that makes total sense
so that egyptian baby girl with two heads died
 a brain infection from when they removed the extra head
is this real or from the weekly world news 
 the extra head could only smile and blink
so the extra head could give head
it had a use
you are really a sick motherfucker
i don't need a bag
you're going to carry that in your hand
that's fine with me
 i love customers who don't want bags
 people need to recycle
 they keep cutting down more and more trees for these bags
plastic bags are made out of trees
 i think it's paper bags that are made out of trees
 "are you pregnant
is that how straight people ask if you got laid
 but i'm kinda worried
 my friends from high school got pregnant like one after the other
it was like abort over here
 abort over there
we was killing baby fetuses every week
you know what i think the worst smell would be
 dirty diapers with rotting flesh wrapped in rubber; all set on fire
 sulfur usually comes along with the burning anyway
 and you know
 that all might smell so bad that it smells good
 you should tell dartmouth that when you interview there
i must have my cloaking device on today
get the fuck out of my way
that's the title of a book
 i was making a literary reference
it's flushed like 3 times and i haven't even sat down yet

 i'm telling her it's a civil rights violation
i already got my excuse
 i'm gonna say it busted when i was riding my bike
 that's no good
 say you was jumpin' up and down
i think it's like
we're not going to kfc
 their food is
 they kill their chickens 
 how do i get to the second floor
you just press "2" and wait for the elevator to go up
they just tell you what floor the exhibit is on
 but they don't tell how to get there
why do i have to pee in a cup

 does this train go to manhattan
i think it's supposed to
 but the n's messed up right now
 the n train's totally gay
 and not in the good way

 i was one
 do you have any biographies of tupac
 though they'd be with the other biographies on the second floor
but isn't this the fiction section
 you might be able to find some books about him in non-fiction
and fiction means false
so if it's in non-fiction then that means he must still be alive
i don't think you understand
 the girl with a face like a chipmunk
poor thing's gonna die a virgin
 married to what
there was too much talking in that movie and not enough action
 it was all like too much communism and shit
 i don't have to remember
 what are you looking at

 i don't need to be no cia
 special agent man

 nothing's free around here
 that's what's wrong with you immigrants
 always looking for something for free
i know what you meant

 but they don't card the asians
affirmative action or something like that

then ask somebody to give you their seat
 then go see a doctor
so then he like
stuck his stick up her hoo-ha
like in her area
 you mean he went for the cash and prizes
 so he like

then you would have to have sex with yourself
 if i could have sex with myself
 i probably would
you know what my mom does
 she bathes in champagne
it's supposed to be good luck
 does she just pour cristal all over herself or something
 i think she puts it on a sponge
i haven't read one page of that animal farm 
 because we're reading 
 do you have veins in your head

 she's an amish person
 why is she allowed to wear so much makeup
 they can't wear makeup
 i don't know what i would do
three billion dollars is a lot of green
 what would you guys do
 i'd get me one of them golden showers
 that's when someone pees on you
i could become a sheriff
 don't you have to take a test to become a sheriff
 what if you have one of those disorders that you throw up whenever you take a test
well i guess you could get a note or something
 you could be like
 "i threw up on my test
 that's why it smells funny
 here's a note
 she want me to give her a kid
 she only 28
 you don't need no kid when you 28
 just start in your thirties and have 'em back to back to back
you make it sound pretty easy to have kids back to back
 that's hard on a woman
and she ain't the only one
 lots of girls want me to give them kids
your sperm is in high demand
what do you want
 you're a good-looking guy
 but sometimes it feels like a curse to be this hot
can you spare some change
is that your boyfriend
 three for me and one for my dog
 like for me one of the biggest issues was religiosity
 was she more or less than you
let me just put it this way: two days after we broke up she was wearing pants
can you spare some change
 could i have another one
 i already gave you one; fuck you
now that's what i call an ungrateful motherfucker
 do you remember how that conversation with jim started today
 fuck you then
so they're throwing a going away thing for him
 is he goin' to jail or somethin'
 he just became a corrections officer
so i had my colonoscopy tuesday
 it was like i lost an hour out of my life

so my girlfriend tells me afterwords like five times that they removed a polyp and that they think it could be pre-cancerous
 i won't know until next week or something

i don't need to go anymore
i just waited in line for ten minutes
 you better fart or something
 it smells like sex in this train
what the hell does sex smell like
 you're a virgin
it smells like sex
 who in this train just got some booty
 was it you
 oh hell naw
 you're too ugly
you really think someone would have sex on a crowded train
i have to run in here and get more chapstick
you just bought chapstick yesterday
my dog steals them and eats them
that must be why his lips are so soft
i don't never know where you at
 i always tell you where i at
 i don't know where you at yesterday
i don't always know where you at neither
 i tell you where i at
 i don't never know where you at till you get from there
those are some fine-lookin' sweaters
do you like them
 i made them
do you think you could make one for him
i would be delighted
 for a chihuahua
 what are you talking about
 i'm talking about the johnny cash song
 a boy named sue 
and i'm talking about my dog being a cross-dresser
 i have to juggle
 i'm pushing a stroller
 walking the dog and holding a big bag of poop
 my espanol class
 it's like shitting a watermelon
what're you gonna do if i poop on myself
 what're you gonna do
is this a magic toilet
all's well that ends well
 i guarantee you that i did not peepee in my pants
why do you have to tease me by pooping at house
 i just peed on myself
talking to you is like taking a shit
what kind of guys do you like
what kind of guys do you like
 i like guys with big tits
if i let you touch my boob
 will you stay longer
 i gotta go
 i don't have time to talk about your nipples right now
she got the ill mole on her face; her cheek look like a titty
 don't you hate it when you're not wearing a bra and like one nipple gets hard and the one doesn't
 you want some breast milk
well i understand that
 but that's no reason to set your nipples on fire
 i got my fried chicken at popeye's; their breasts are mad big
 they like double ds
i think i'm going to be a lactation consultant
i'm sure there are people in this world who have a fetish for big boobs and juice boxes
my dick was totally in one hand pissing while i was talking to the client
 all you need to do is give a girl a nice stiff cock and she'll let you do whatever you want
so we're goin' at it and he starts screaming and runs out of the bedroom
 and i like follow him and he's standing there in the kitchen with his dick in a glass of milk
i keep tasting weiner
 do you really want to get on your 
 it's the end of the night
 i guess i'll put this in my mouth instead of a penis
 he has a mole on his dick
 he has a mole on his dick
 i thought you always had your dick washed by 7
i need you to give me a ride home when i get off the bus
 my grandma has been standing in front of my house for over one hour
i bet you anything she needs money again
 they're actually a dime a dozen
i don't want an intern making my fuckin' coffee
 much less produce my fuckin' show
that's not true; someone once charged me seven dollars and fifty-three cents for a smile
 you workin' hard
 what type of reward you gettin'
 monetary or bootitary
i made a new year's resolution to be less responsible
 but it just didn't work
i am just kicking myself for spending all that money on that stupid funeral
i'm going to get in to work early tomorrow so i can quit
you're not listening to me
 it's not about the snack
 it's about the fact that i've had a really hard day and i want to unwind a little
i would like to inform you of something you already know
 you are all very cheap
i have to cash this check; i just got out of jail and i need the money
we're being listed through mr
when i see that tenants have their windows open
 i shut down the boilers
 if there's a cold snap after that and they complain that there's no heat
 you had your windows open for a week
he only put two thousand dollars in my account
 so we can't go too crazy
 would i be selling it if it weren't any good
when she traded her kid for the house
 i lost all respect for her
 he always blames it on the train dispatcher
 he needs to own his problems
move to the front of the train
 there's more room at the front
 you missed it
 and that was the last one
 we'll set up cots on the platform so you can spend the night
i couldn't fit on that train
 i want my money back
 what they need to do is gentrify the subways
i'll be there shortly
i'm stuck on the train on the bridge
is 14th street the next stop
you know how we be hopping turnstiles all the time
 i get so used to it
 i hopped the turnstile on the way out the station
 cop saw me and grabbed me
 cop was all
 "date of birth
 "i was going out
" and he's all
 "still looks like a hop to me
ever notice how ugly new yorkers are
don't take my word for it; just look at the person sitting next to you
where the hell is the uptown 6 train
 this is crazy
 where the hell is the uptown 6 
this is the shuttle bus for the number 2 train
 don't expect to get where you are going in an hour
 it's gonna take two
 if you don't like it

 or get a ride with a friend
 or stay home
 she didn't sound chinese over the phone
free prisoners of war
 that's what i do
 perpetually disappoint people

 i have been looking for my phone for the last 5 minutes and i can't find it anywhere
did the real sex live up to the phone sex
she had yo brother when she was nine
 yo momma a freak
am i on speaker phone
mom is always listening in on the other line when i talk to dad
 the other night he said
 "you're such a nice person"
 and i said i must have got that from him and we heard a click
no guy would spend that much time texting you if he wasn't serious
 that's the worst
 when you're jerking off and a friend calls
 like you really want to jerk off
 but you really want to talk to your friend too
did you see that woman
 she looked at us like she'd never seen a black man before
i just said the n-word in front of a "n"
 the africans: they black
 the asians: they black
 there gonna be too many of us
they are some racist fuckers in there
 they wouldn't help me because they are so racist
 and you know what
 that racist motherfucker was a bin laden bitch too
i get the best reaction from the blacks
 the black people are more spiritual
 they got one up on us
 but it's not us and them
 we're all one person
 you're just a different shade of white
 and i'm a different shade of black
there's fuckin' cops everywhere
 the worst ones are black
 no wonder everyone hates 'em
four generations out of slavery
 and now i command a robot army
 you are telling me 6 o'clock
 can you give that
there will be soap
i like to play in the dirt
and i like to do dirty things 
i can feel the juice runnin' down my leg
 it's leaking 
if i'd just taken a shower everything would have been all right
you gotta come early
 like 5 o'clock
 when they're still clean
 you don't need another dick already in 'em
 not eating anything ever is not a way of cleansing your body
the next time you complain that i don't take the trash out
 i'm going to remind you that it was not me who put beef blood in our bed
the sight and smell of it was so disgusting
 how many times have i told you
 don't lick the bird shit
 i think i just farted on a model
 this q train is currently making local stops due to the 12 cups of snow outside
sometimes you can't see love
 but you can feel it
 it's like the wind
 it's raining ice
 slutty people don't get cold
 father nature caught mother nature cheatin' on him
 and dropped some damn snow on us
 who doesn't like being warm
 it's not like they call it "global sweltering"
 so who cares
 the delay is due to the 12 cups of snow outside
 i'm shopping with my mom
 and she's shopping for 
usually my bedroom is off-limits but i let my son go read in there the other night and i walk in and he's going though my drawers and he found my dildo 
and he knew what it was
 if they ever ask you for a massage
 don't get one
 they strap this weird dildo thing on their hands and then rub it all over your face
 then it makes this chuga chuga chuga sound
 this one's named excalibur
 it's a rabbit
 stimulated by a 50 cent banana
 all i remember is that when i woke up in the morning there was a cucumber with your menstrual blood on it
 what did you think of him
i don't see what he sees in him
 why is he with someone that homely if he doesn't have
and did you see his teeth
there isn't enough money for me to stick my dick in that
 can you tell us how to get to the corner of madison and park
 those streets run--
 he doesn't know
 we just came from there
 so let's just go back the way we came
hey a six-legged lamb was born in belgium over the weekend
are they sure it wasn't a four=legged spider
 a spider with wool
who needs variety when we got fucking spiderlambs
let's go to the other wing
 i'm not that interested in seeing the modern art
then why are we at the museum of modern art
we're going to try to get the line moving quicker
 anyone who is in a group of 2 or more people
 have 1 person stand in line and buy tickets
 the other members of your group can go to a waiting area and you can meet them there
but what if all 3 of us want to go up to the top
and i will totally sell you my old shuffle
 all iproducts suck
 you might offend the girl with the ipod
 she can't hear us with those ear things in
 do you have the time

i wish i could have that cookie
it's nice to wish
do you know that she got into brooklyn university
 they must let everyone in there
 or maybe long island university
 or maybe brooklyn university in long island
 i wanna be on 
like the tv show
but everything has been done already
they could make you into a lesbian
so we basically spent the entire day having sex on sunday
 how do you get any chores done
well maybe you should start seeing a therapist
i bet you they'll just say i'm paranoid
how come you don't eat me out anymore
you have ridiculously strong thighs
when you cum you crush my head
 you're such a pussy
i want to have three kids
 first a boy
 then two girls
what if it doesn't happen in that order
there are ways to make it happen
hall of psychics 
so i took out the butter
 in the butter dish
it had been an avocado
 like a year ago
so i just skipped breakfast
what did you do with it
what do you mean
 what did i do with it
 did you throw the whole butter dish away or what
i just put it back in the fridge
 i remember you; i don't like you
i still don't like you either
 you still gotta wash your ass
 stop smokin' crack and wash your asshole
i don't normally carry a bag of vomit with me as a weapon
we should market that
spare some change for the leprechaun
 i just need four dollars to get back over the rainbow

i didn't come all the way from new jersey to watch a fucking parade; i came here to drink
 i am wasted
 this is the anniversary of my nipple piercing
i just wanted to say that
 you're not wearing green
i thought it was irish
have you ever been on the east side on st
 i was there last year
 and there were guys--grown men--wearing business suits and everything
 just pissing in the middle of the street
 it was magical
god bless the irish
 and god bless john gotti too
if you're wearing a green hat like that i get to bitch-slap you
why is everyone wearing green today
 i had kind of a rough time getting up this morning and just wanted to say i'm sorry for anything i did last night
so how are you
well he's only ten years older than me
 he's probably some sick pedophile
it's not so bad
when i was sixteen he was only 24

your pants are so tight
 your balls have asthma
but that's my joke
you in need of a husband

where does it say that
 on that sign
"i won't be home until after i go to the pharmacy
 the third month in a row that she forgot
 at $2 a pill
 i guess it's better than the alternative
 i don't get it
the last guy she slept with was eleven inches
 she is from queens
what's a pipe dream
it's like a farfetched dream
 i always thought it was
 an idea someone got when they were high and they thought it was a good idea at the time because
 they were stoned
i don't get it
 c-town has more of a selection
i don't know why you have to ruin this experience for me
when i got on the bus today
 there was a needle on the seat next to me and i didn't know what to do with it
 there could have been syphilis on it or something
 i was thinking more like aids
do you have any brothers or sisters
i am number 14 of 28 children
 are you a half hindu
 i'm a full hindu
 i just love krishna
what did she just say
and i didn't even go to first base with her
 i wouldn't give her the satisfaction
 we were with the ugliest girls in the world that night
you should date the jew; he would take you out to dinner and then they bone you
 as opposed to the catholic ones that we just bone and skip dinner altogether
life is just a game
some people do crosswords
 i wake up in the morning
 my eye is twitching
 i don't see anythinig
 are you sure
 i can feel it
 i can feel it but no one can see it
i don't see it
it's not my eyeball

 this happens to sheila
 and no one else can see
 only it's half of her face
it's witch-tit cold out here

it's like "cold as a witch's teat"
 but updated for the 21st century
so i was standin' in front of the door in the train the other day
 and this old lady shoves me like three times when the doors opened
 i stepped aside to look at her and i pushed her like this
what did she do
she just looked and me and walked out

 with computers these days
 you type in one thing wrong and it ain't gonna come out right
 it's those young girls in the office that don't pay no attention to what they're doin'
 they have their fake press-on nails and damn fake hair
 and they spend all day running their fake nails through their fake hair instead of watching the keyboard
 you're just jealous
what was the name of your vibrator
 was it pedro or paco
 it was my first one: sergei
 why did i say pedro
 where did that come from
my first 's name was pedro
i didn't know what to do
 so i took a used tissue out
it's better than letting it drip on the table
sometimes the office gets so hot
 people come in tank tops
one time i went to a meeting and a drip of sweat fell from my head
 i was mortified
now i make sure i stand in an air-conditioned room for 15
why do they put peas in the fried rice
 peas and carrots

 you never even let me put my feet on the furniture when i stay with you
that is because your feet were covered with warts
warts that i caught from the mother wart that was on your foot
when i was a kid
 i would always invent things on the train
 i'd tell my mom about them and then a month later they'd get invented
 it happened like three times that i talked to my mom about something on the train and then it got invented

 if she throws that cooter in your face you're gonna be eating cooter for dinner tonight
i just talked about rimming and clitoral stimulation on an academic panel
 how do you i feel
she was sitting there spread-eagle
and all my friends got a glimpse of the gobbler
i have every confidence in her as a person
 but that doesn't extend to her being able to contract her vaginal muscles into the shape of a whooping crane
my clit isn't that big
 but it is perfect
 it's very active
today was the first day i took a celebrex since the pogo stick thing
so i went to the gynecologist today

that's like our little routine
 we have sex and then i stand on his back and crack it
 just like that: sex

 so if he says anything i don't like
 i can just zap him

 i don't think so; mammals always lay eggs
 that was a long time

i don't give a rat's ass if you're late for work
 i don't care if you get to work and your boss punches you in the face and breaks your nose
 i have the right to look for a seat
every day she does that
 i can't take it anymore
 i really like vacuuming
 that i like to clean
 i'm a woman

i wanted to see if it was possible to walk here from campus in 20 minutes
 it took me 22
 and i think my boots are filled with blood
i'm not going to the gym today
 this is like the gazillionth time you've cancelled
 and i didn't want to have to tell you this
 but you give me no choice
 you're starting to get fat
 you need to start going to the gym
 every day or no man's gonna wan't you
you gays are so fucking judgmental
 and since i'm such a fat cow
 you can go find someone else to help you stretch and have to deal with your sweaty balls in their face
which one did you make out with
 i can't tell the difference
 whichever one is jessica
so i need to get me a bible

 what's the commotion about

 let's get a move on
 hey shortie with the red hair
 i'm talkin' to you
 and i'm ignoring you
 they should have a phone where you just say 92454
 they already have that
 but without numbers
they should also have a video phone
 so you can see who you're talking to
they already have that
 technology is good
 but it's also stupid
technology is going to destroy us
 it's natural and it can be a very beautiful thing
you wouldn't say that if you heard what eleanor told me
what's she look like
but you said she's black
 she's neither african nor american
 her family must have come from africa at some point
 like 1000 years ago
 then she's african
are you all right
i don't get why they call it the 7 years war if it didn't really take 7 full years
 why don't you write your own motherfucking textbook about history and call it whatever the fuck you want
 and nobody will read it
 because you don't know shit about what we're doing second semester
he told me not to worry about his girlfriend
 he was like
 "you know you're gonna like it

 my mom used to work there

 so the passengers can get on
 i don't care
 i got a seat
acting like y'all each other's enemies
 do you want to know why she was so delicious
 she was such a snotty bitch and then her card declined
 i was like

you let her know when i come up there i'm gonna put my foot in her ass
do you have a lawyer's number handy
 i'm gonna sue that fuck smiley
 i hear you
 i can see your garden
 but i don't know that i want to play there
if you don't come back here and apologize right now
 you're going into the trashcan again
you know they are going to give me a gold leaf for putting up with you
that ryan guy is so hot
 i'd totally do him
 i'd fuck him so hard
 but only if
 he never talked
 because he's an asshole
 let's find a cafe and talk shit
i can play hard to get
 if i don't like someone
 i am really hard to get
you can't just be standin' around slappin' people all day
i finally just pushed an old lady because
 i wasn't gonna be father christmas holding the door for everyone all day
'cause all i'm sayin' is
 what's your passion
 what's your passion
 'cause all your passion right now is bitchy
 i don't think it's been that cold lately
 but this little b-i-t-c-h right here needed to have the $65 parka
you are late today
 i don't care
 have a nice day
i just can't like somebody that i dislike so much
that's a good thing i didn't get my hands stuck 'cause i need them to slap my kids
being a jew in europe is like being a homosexual in wyoming
if it wasn't for nyu we wouldn't be going to croatia
i do what i want; i'm an egyptian
 they spit on me when i returned from vietnam
 what you've gotta do is put a 
45 to their head and blow their brains out
 that'll send the rest of 'em running for the woods
 that's how you back your buddy up who died
 you didn't say
 "where is massachusetts
 "how do you get to massachusetts
 "what is massachusetts
 i wanna take you to miami and put you under a palm tree and do some cocaine
new jersey must be empty right now
 i don't understand how those fucking immigrants can come here like this
 what are you
 in love with me or something
 is that why you're looking at me
 you're looking at me because you don't fucking have anything else to do
 they're from hungria
i'm afraid of pit bulls
 so i moved to santa fe
 this train smells
 did it come through jersey on the way here
there's no one left in this place
 i've killed everyone
the french language has very little accentation
 i never get cold
 i'm from iceland
i've always thought pennsylvania was above new york
 it's more on the side
 that's never something i would do
 then i actually swallowed it
 and i totally forgot how bad
 have i got a piece for 
 you're my boy
 that's where it's at
we're not going to coney island
 the city of dreams
i have the same birthday as burt reynolds and he didn't invite you to his fucking party so you better be coming to mine
 i'm so happy
 this is so awesome
 i've always wanted to be a witness in a murder trial
it's just like on law and order 
 but real life 
the day a tv reaches out and touches us
 much less if we add fragrance
 that would be a disaster
who the hell is paris hilton
 and why should i give a damn about her
 let 'em off
 it's just like sex
 you gotta get it out to get it in
if you want e or f service
 you need to get on this train and take it to union turnpike
 if you are still wandering around on this platform
 you are lost 
 get on this e train
 you always be gettin' raped on the l train
 at this time i would like to remind you not to leave any unattended bags on the subway
 if you do see any suspicious package
 please go to the nearest atm
 the nearest mta employee and let them know
you need to move your trash bag out of the center of the aisle and pick up your pretzel wrappers
this is 59th street-columbus circle
 next stop is 62nd street
 you're missing out
 the l train is the one with waiter service
the next stop is the next stop
 stand clear of the closing doors
the fucking metrocard is racist
 you're all racist
 all my brooklyn peoples
 where you at
 where you at
 you need to stay on this train
 do not move
 this here is a brooklyn-bound c train
 ladies and gentlemen
 sorry for the interruption
 i am selling candy
 not for no basketball team
 not for no class trip
 but for myself
 to keep money in my pocket
 to keep me off the streets and off your fire escape
stand clear of the closing doors
 145th street is next
 i take that back
 155th street is next
163rd street is the next stop
i'm not part of the bridge and tunnel crowd

 you guys in that last car

 i'm gonna sue the mta for stank
 not crush hour
 there's another train behind us
 that is the third time your purse has hit me in the head
 i asked you nicely to please move over
 this is not a seat
 it is my shoulder
 and you are sitting on it
 the train is not crowded and there is no reason for you to be on top of me
this is a manhattan-bound e train; there is no v service on the weekends
 if you insist on waiting for the v train
 one should be along at about 5am monday morning
 i have to go
 i'm too distracted on the phone
 and i don't trust anyone in this terminal
 people are speaking spanish behind me
 if you know what i mean
 sometimes there's just too much pinata
 now that i'm back from mexico water here tastes so
i quit that job
 they treated me like i was a mexican
i don't know what you want from me
i don't dance and i don't speak spanish
 i didn't like it
 puerto rico is like the new york of mexico
just tell the spanish girls art students don't wear clothes
 all drawing is naked drawing
 especially when you're spanish
i'm starting to see a lot more blacks and hispanics around here
 we must be in "da hood"
i talked to her for 10 minutes and figured out she was crazy
you guys aren't here to help me; you're just here to bust my balls
 what the fuck is wrong with all of you
 lemme get through
 my roommate was having issues with his girlfriend who's psycho and he goes to my other roommate for advice
 he's cheating on his girlfriend who's also psycho
if i was a crackhead
 i would not go to a crackhead to figure out how to stop smoking crack
i don't what planet they think they from
 but these humans ain't all they cracked out to be
 how you doin'
 you all right
 'cause you gotta make two more of those
 you gotta make two more of those
 you all right
 i step in dog shit all the time
 i used to play the horses
 one time i stepped in dog shit and then i won $750
 you should learn to step in more dog shit
it's a long story involving a lot of urine
 but the gist of it is
 we can't use that refrigerator ever again
just a sec while i go and get a drink from the toilet
 none of the chicks are going
 but clean the bathroom
 i'm sure it's disgusting
 this girl is 
she wanted me to pee in her mouth
 all white girls are freaks
 she asked me to in her 
none of us wore a scarf tonight
 that's fucking toilet paper
 did i poop on the bathtub
you know why your ass stinks
 'cause shit come outta there 
i ate so much of this stuff this week that my pee smells like progresso soup
i have to pee so bad
how does a motherfucker pee
don't you know how slow the digestive system works
 you won't start shitting corn until around 10 o'clock tonight
i took the biggest craziest shit this morning
 tore me apart
if i fucking pee myself it's not my fault
you're so lucky i didn't have my uti
 i would've wet my pants
where's your section for books about hippies
 did you notice that guy standing in the doorway is reading how to win friends and influence people 
 and he's standing in the doorway 
but i think our conversations right now are at the height of what conversation could ever be
 the only thing that could make them better is if we read books
 do we have the book in hindi
there was a guy that was helping me before
 he's really smart and it's like he was reading my mind
 do you know where i can find him
if they don't get that motherfucker by the end
 i ain't never gonna read another richard north patterson book again
 like peter pan 
all the women in this book get screwed
 literally and physically
i've never been blonde
 i had blonde roots once
i scraped my nipple on john's beard
you should see the hair in my armpits
 i fucking have pubic hair on my chest
 it stop there
your ain't doin' nuthin' 
 it's the you comb yo 
i be straight as a perm
i don't even know she has a straightener
 her hair's curly
 needs a perm
 'cause perms for us are
 they're straight for curly people
 i totally wish i was in india right now where you can buy like anything on the internet
 like human organs and shit
 i meant to google "himmler" today
 but i forgot
 so now there are nudie pictures of me out on the internet
it was good with a caps lock g
so when i got home on chat they were like
 "on the next block after you left there were these 7 spanish kids and they took our cell phones
did you see how that lady looked at me
 it was like
 "what hole did that tribal crawl out of
" i'll hit her with my motherboard
 i'm so glad to see you
 i've been thinking about you' i just read that book radically gay 
i can go back
 i can go front
 bob is gay
girl you got to get yourself a life
 i've got a life
 i got your man on top of it
 after i slept with her brother's boyfriend
 it got kinda awkward
you can go to jail for that
 and in jail
 you turn gay
gay guys are just uninhibited straight guys
that girl is mad gay
 maybe that chinese kid farted egg roll
and i was like
 "great coffee" and
 "can i have some change
" so then i said
" and--you're gonna love this--she went
 "i'm not chinese
 i just realized i forgot my change
this is grand street
 homemade bok choi
you're chinese and a virgin
 can i shake your hand
chinese takeout people are so stupid
 they can't even spell "dynasty"
 there is no "t" in it
korean girls are crack dealers
 he fits more in his restaurant
 in half the size
 than anyone else
come get your umbrellas
 100% genuinely made in 
the thing about chinese weddings is that after you go to
 three of them you realize you're not chinese
 it's where they train hunters
 elmer fudd goes there
i heard that if you inject enough [mumblemumble]into his bloodstream
 in a couple of hours
 the coroner can't tell the cause of death
that isn't fucking funny
 piece of shit
 fucking hors d'oeuvres on wheels
have you heard of the sleeper
it's when you sit on your hand for five minutes then rub one out
 it feels like someone else is jerking you off
i'm trying that as soon as i get home man
and the next thing you know
 you'll be doing miss congeniality 3 
 here's the train
 that's the q
 you couldn't pay me to take the q
 last time i took the q
 i got on around canal street and next thing i knew
 i was in
remember when your shit was all yellow and shit
 what happened then
you doing number one in there
 because if you're talking when you're doing number two it don't come out right
that bitch kind of looks like her dog
 but she's busted
 i'd definitely pipe the dog before i piped her
 this is the worst day of my life
 you're still a small fry
i am a "small fries
" why do you keep saying that
nice to see you again
how much are these
 that is ridiculous
well maybe you should stop buying yourself flowers and get a man to buy them for you
i don't look like an eskimo
 i have a tan
i thought eskimos were darker skinned
i thought eskimos were darker
 i think their skin is darker
i think they have darker skin
anyway i think it'd be funny to see you in an igloo
 is there a bathroom at the next stop
 i just felt the rumblings of the communist invasion
 and i'm less than prepared
 i need to get my license
 i'm telling you when you get that shit you'll be walking along like you are king jafee-jafee of zamundo
you know that song that billy strayhorn wrote
 called "take the a train"
 he wrote it about taking the a train up to harlem
 and then he gave it to duke ellington
 the rest is history
you gotta figure out what you're gonna study in college
 you oughta check out this holistic college
 for holistic medicine
 like holistic medicine
it's a two-year program to get certified and it's all hippies who are all potted up so you don't have to do anything
 like "sit on this crystal and write a paper about it
 so then you're certified
 you oughta do that
maybe i'll be a pilot
lemme get a bacon
 we don't have bacon
can i have it on a bagel then
that's not the problem
 we don't have any bacon
can i just have a bacon
 egg and cheese
 there is no bacon
can i just have your number then
i've always wanted to try coke
it's not that good
 but i hear heroin's great
why didn't you go in his room and see if he was home
so i could go in there and see him with his dick out
 porn all over the place
 passed out like he exhausted himself
and who the hell told you that junk
 oh i'm gonna that bitch to 
 let me ask the manager
i'm getting my hair cut really short
i don't think that will ever happen
 you're like goliath with your hair
 is that who it is
 i'm not a giant
i'm a customer and you're saying i can't use the restroom
you can't use it this often
 you come here every day and stay there for 20-25 minutes
 i don't know what you're doing in there
well if you want to get so technical
 the first time i was taking a dump
he took it; it'll both depict us
i don't want to be both depicted
 i want my own shit
did you just fart
that's an awkward question
is that a yes
can anyone spare some change for a homeless man
 can anyone spare a penny
 i got to get off this train
 get out of my way
you're not going to get much with that sales pitch
and the area is really gentrifying quite nicely
 the people from the projects never come over to this side of the neighborhood
 so it's a great place to raise a family
could you folks help me out with some money to buy food
 give me money
 i haven't eaten in three days
 i work on commission
 [to his clients]
 you just cost me a commission
maybe it has to do with grover cleveland
i'm a canadian and know who grover cleveland is
 i'm an american and i don't know
 haven't they figured out yet that if you hang around the nation long enough
 you'll get hired
what's with all the bruises
my boyfriend likes to bite
 you dating vampires now but you still won't go out with tommy
 so if you had a pencil
 and she was naked
 you could totally fit the pencil in the folds under her ass
 she's just flappy
 your vagina's open
and there's a smell
and it's a personal smell
so my friend from new jersey just texted me
 she's pregnant and wants to me to be the godfather
 that dude's hair is always fucked up
 he don't got no hair
 i mean his head is fucked up
 a parking garage
 you know what time it is
 you got a face so pretty
 i swear i'll have to cut you if you don't tell me what time it is
i just left a major deposit sitting in that toilet
you didn't flush it
it was an automatic flusher and nothing happened
 there was a guy waiting to go in and i just gave him a shit-eating grin when i walked out
 what am i supposed to do
i wouldn't use the term "shit-eating grin" the next time you tell that story
i heard he's in some shit
 that's some shit
 and now tell me honestly
 is it better to have sex high or not-high
what are you talking about
 of course high is better
would you shut up and let the man answer
 no manners with this one
 [to friend] so which is it
 so i have to walk the red carpet
 my feet are trashed
 but how much walking will i actually have to do
 i was trying on gowns the other day
 but i have to find a smaller one
 they were too big
 what do you think my job was when i was in pr
 borrowing gowns from stars
is your camel dead yet
should i have my baby shower before or after my wedding
you'd better have it before
 you're going to be really drunk after your wedding
 one of them is going to be in july
 i know that for sure
dude i swear to god
 i was on my bed with this mad hot chick and we were making out for like a whole hour
 did you put it in
i was feeling her down there
she had a cock
 did you put it in
i think true love is when you know someone isn't perfect but you still think they are
i thought love was when you could still feel butterflies in your heart even after he tells you he thinks he's an elf
i keep forgetting that actually happened
 and not to you
 i don't know how i would have taken it
that was so good
 i'm so full
 if this were freshmen year
 i would totally go puke
so you like the kid more than the pussy
are you crying cause you're really hurt
 or are you crying cause you're a baby
you are married and have kids
 you can't just fuck a bunch of guys because you think you missed out
 do not co-inhabit 
 i'm a fag because i want to break your heart
what is attractive about mike is that he is infertile
 coming soon to a station stop near you
automated cartoon movie life
 i don't want it
i ain't even playin'
 this is not a game
 i can eat the pussy for three hours
if you were playing risk
 and you were charles darwin
 would you place all of your armies on the galapagos islands
 the thirty years war ended four hundred years ago
 get over it
the english people that lived on the island respected her because she is italian
 and the english respect italians because they respected the romans
piazza -- it means "little pizza
they told me to meet them at a restaurant
 ray's pizza ain't a restaurant
 it's a fucking slobfest
 they got mexicans working there
 they should clean up that shit
 what the fuck are they there for
just because you're high on coke doesn't mean you can't eat pizza
this pizza is good
 whoever left it
 a roma tomato
 i mean lemon
 this is the wrong number
i'm not a crunchy vegan
i'm more like a lipstick vegan
where are the cigarettes
 why are you eating dim sum
you don't even know
 i'd slice a bitch for a pork chop
 how do you say "altar boy"
 the ones whose little dicks the priest sucks
i wish i was jewish -- i'm hungry
the catholic church is so stupid
 harry potter--he's a good kid
 and there's good and bad everywhere
 just look at all the bad shit the catholic church has done
 can tell you through telekenesis all the bad shit that church has done over the years
for christ's fucking sake
 wait till we're off the train
the kid got his ass beat
 he deserved it
this chick was so ugly i wouldn't want to cum on her face
 most korean girls are really photogenic
 just not you
i am so glad my ex-boyfriend and i have become friends again
 i know he sued me and everything
 but it just feels so good
you do not have a receptive bone in your fucking body
can i just tell you how much i hope my manager gets hit by a car
you never want to go to barbados when i want to go to barbados
the audacity of him tearing up this beautiful african-american pussy and not calling me afterwards
a billion guys finger fuck a girl and walk away
 why i gotta get the only man who thinks it's love
isn't "volvo" the medical term for a vagina
he was all over me
 he said he couldn't get enough of me
 of course he has alzheimer's
 look at that
 those would make great earrings
 how's your vagina
and the hotline to tell me what my incurable disease is is only open from like 7 to 9
 you can't tell me my blood is dirty and then have the hotline close
 everything seemed to have checked out okay
 but when the doctor came back with my urine sample he said he was concerned about my pee being to dry
we can damn near make blind people see and we don't have an orange peeler

you have a really nice speaking voice
 you should think about it
you really think so

 you should give it a try
 no matter how rich we get
 i refuse to move to california
because i refuse to have a spoiled brat for a child
 i would want to raise them in new york
 won't they be spoiled either way
 but i'd rather have a hamptons brat than an oc brat
 i just tie it up with string and put it next to my nutsack
that's why i don't go to that church anymore

 only difference is our testicles hang on the outside of our bodies
 i got this suit just for the interview

 i look so good in this suit i could probably get away with incest
one of the hardest things to get away with
after seeing that last body
 i understand how he really did break his penis last year
 and you said he was just faking it
 there's a lot of weird stuff down here
 this must be the "beyond" part
 there is an express bound
 there is an express bound manhattan train

 but it better not be any of that cheap shit
the only time i ever gave head i was really drunk
 i just remember when he started cumming
 i jumped up and screamed "ew

 that's why i think third base is disgusting
 i just skip over it
 don't go to third base
 he totally meatballed me
is that the last harry potter
 there's one more after this
 how old is he
 isn't he getting a little old to be in school
 that's why he goes to magic school
 harry rides the short train to school
jackhammering is when you're banging her head against the wall repeatedly while plowing her
 that's a battering-ram
 i prefer rodney king style
 beating her senseless while taking care of business

 one cook back there didn't hear you
 why am i
what is your shirt made of
 it's from forever 21

we were talking on the phone and then
was it hard for you
 i don't care
if the doormen went on strike

i need a cigarette
you don't need them
 you're gonna smoke one
 and one day you're gonna wake up and you're gonna be dead

 there is no need to rush onto this train
 pushing others and possibly risking a fall
 this is a 6 train and at this time of day there will be another 6 train every 5 minutes
 so there is no need to risk injury
 there will be another 6 train coming in 5 minutes
 what do you think this is
 the tunaville trolley
 this is the 6 train
9/11 was 3 years ago
 9/11 happened 5 years ago

 can you tell me where i can get some dressing
 i don't know
 i've never had a salad here before

i recognize that accent
 where are you from
 i'm from north carolina
right next to tennessee
 dating gets so much harder as we get older
 especially if you're intelligent
it's not like you can just look at a woman and tell if she's smart enough to date
i'd never date an aries though
 when in rome
 who said that
 was it jesus
 i think it was jesus
and the cookies from the sky
 all them cookies from the sky
 like fuckin' meteors

 but it's worth it anyway
 my appetite's gone
have you ever been to d
yeah i used to go there and go to museums all the time for spring break because i'm not a
 go-to-mexico-and-get-date-raped kind of person
 don't they have dead babies there
 dead babies are the best type of babies
sometimes i wish i was a mexican
 a mexican boy
 life would be so much easier
 [pause] you know
 because they always have a lot of roommates
 15 mexican boys live together
 that's why you broke up
 i don't blame you -- you gotta microwave them first
 otherwise they're too spongey
do these trains go under water
we're under water right now
ain't you people heard of the treaty of versailles
 i gots mothafuckin' rights
washington square park is the vibrant center of campus
 you can't just be dropping mustard gas on me
 like that mothafucka from tennessee be doin'
 the treaty of versailles says i got rights
 they have mustard gas here now
 i you this city wasn't safe
this bitch understands that i got rights
he had so much damn earwax
 sleeping with boys like that is just so awkward
 your standards are just off because you dated a fetus
 want some ice cream
don't think of it as losing a friend
but as gaining a holiday destination
 but is this makeout room
 i noticed it before but i never realized it was the makeout room
 walking on this little scenic trail by the river looking down the hill and we see rocks
 there aren't any fire escapes in this building
 at least not any that we have access to
i'ma go back to 1903 when there wasn't nobody around
so where's the fun aisle
 peter got the good cubicle
 with the high walls
 spelled b-y-o-c 
 some shit like that
and as i walked out the door i said to her
 "one last thing - if your pussy is so good
 why don't you eat it yourself
that guy smelled like a bag full of assholes
 and that's why you have herpes
this place is way gayer than last time
 tonight i'm either hanging out with fags or lesbos
 all we do in that class is talk about gay porn for 3 hours
nigga can't get a woman anymore because every fuckin' man is 
 every time i open my eyes i see gay men 
 no more straight men out there

 i ain't ; i like 
 that's why we got aids because every man's a gay man 
 you stick da dick in da butthole you get aids

 all dem dicks in da buttholes

as soon as i met him
 my gaydar exploded
and then i had to change my pants

 they're not going to kill you
 mormons don't kill
 you have to stop
 i'll have a fag attack if you don't stop those shoes right there
if i had my way
 i'd take all the homosexuals and burn them in auschwitz
i've fired 3 people in the last 2 weeks
 one girl was fat
 but she didn't know it
 she would come into work with her belly falling out of her shirt
 i just couldn't take it anymore
 my diet pills are kicking in so i have to get off the phone and go to the gym
ever since she went skeletor she
i can't decide if eating will make me feel better
i'm not bad in bed
 you're just 
 these people need to realize they're and they are too 
 women in this country are 
 you can't be on this train because you're too 
 your balls aren't as big as my ass
 so shove over
why is my leg fat so fuckin' jiggly
just because she's heinous doesn't mean i'm not trying
 she weighs more
it's her attitude that makes her heinous
i need to work on my abs
so what time are we meeting them to go to the restaurant to eat
yeah she's not big as a house
 maybe a small cottage
you know what i mean
 they got these 400 pound cops comin' in and arresting people for weed
 you know what i'm saying
 it's the same thing
 they're addicted to food and it's okay
her ass was so small
 she was worthless
she fat for a girl that ain't fat
 'cause girls ain't supposed to be fat
 she was like a size negative zero
with this many books you are almost certain to make a mistake in your choice
do you have malcolm x's autobiography
 i don't know who wrote it
i read all of pride and prejudice in one day
 and then i realized that it's stupid
 and that jane austen is superficial
 like the witch
 and the lion 
if i were you
--and i am just that
 a time-shifted version of you--i would open the book to appendix c
 it means "less miserables
did i say barnes and nobles
 i work at starbucks
 that's like birds
 i'm not a racist
 i went to berkeley
 that's the great things about history papers
 i once wrote a four page paper with eleven citations
 it was fucking awesome
if i weren't poor white trash
 i'd be fully ivy league educated
that's why i'm so bored at nyu
 you know what i need to learn about
 the metric system
i can't date a woman who's taller than me
 i can't date a woman who's a lot smarter than me
 i haven't met any smart women
you teach literature in a school and you talk about the president 
 at least he's done something with his life
that's plagiarism; that's different than ripping someone off
i'm never going to be in the "in crowd" because the "in crowd" are all molecular biologists and have labs
i haven't been inviting everyone; i just told them they could fucking come
i know it's going to be boring
 but we'll have so much fun that we won't notice how boring it is
she didn't even invite her children to her birthday party
i don't know for sure
 she said she was trying to cut back the guest list
so we'll finish up sheet 15 and move onto sheet 16
 it'll be a party
 i can't wait
 it'll be my "sheet 16" party
i think it's "alzheimer's"; they're old but it's not "oldsheimer's"
if you get in that cab
 i'll hide your viagra your teeth
 he won't bite
 i'd bite you first
 and i left my dentures upstairs
what's gonna look good on her when she's 90
 i'm old school
 but i'm not
he was all over me
 he said he couldn't get enough of me
of course he has alzheimer's
 no one else on this train likes children 
you are 6 years old
 and your brother is 4
 i can't wear acrylic nails no more
 i flew off the handle and grabbed michael so hard they started cracking and making my fingers bleed
 and i can't be worried about bleeding fingers when i'm punishing my son
 i'm being assaulted by a child
 i'm from harlem
 i should be chasing you
 i'm from harlem
 i wouldn't have kids; you have to buy them little red jackets
 and that cuts into your beer money
 you've got them running all over your house while you're trying to smoke a joint
 kids should be drinking liquor at 12
 it's just like my kids
 i tune it right out
 this is why i hate you fucking people
 you act like monsters
you heard they called acs on that bitch
how you let your baby fall out the high chair
what have i told you about bodily fluids in public
 i just heard that katie holmes had her baby
 katie holmes had her baby
xenu commands you to shut the fuck up while i'm on the phone with my dealer
 you think that bitch is gonna blow up the train
 she's not fly
 that girl is fresh
 always buying stuff at old navy and wearing it the next day
 when i buy clothes
 i let them sit in the closet for a week
 until i feel like wearing them
 i was there until 1:30
 they loved me
 you talk too loud
 i've been calling for someone and waiting in aisle 2 for ten minutes
 and no one came
 this is ridiculous
 you people are incompetent
 you have things stacked so they fall
 look at my pants
so why are you telling me
because you work here
why did you move my beverage to the floor
you're not supposed to have drinks on the train
 especially not on the seats
it's not going to spill
 are you a cop
 i'm a taxpayer
 i have rights
 i'm a cop
can you be a taxpayer and a cop
if you could take over any country which one would you pick
what do you mean
 control the army
 stuff like that
that's a hard question
 i'm not that well traveled
 people are so different in every country
 what if you could spend a year there
 get to know the place
i stayed the night at her place and woke early
 she was still asleep
what did you do
i got up and was going to make myself breakfast
 but when i cracked the egg open it got away from me
where did it go
it slid down a crack between the counter and the stove
what did you do
i put everything away and climbed back into bed
you know that shit is going to stink
 i'm sure it will
 this quarter say pennsylvania on the back
 it's a commemorative quarter
 but it say pennsylvania
 those are the new quarters
 but if i find out i can't spend this
 i'm bringin' it back in here
 our ra put up this poster listing these words we're not

 it's offensive to gypsies or something
do gypsies even to nyu
 let alone college
maybe she's from romania and shit
i may not be able to drive you to the sleepover at joey's father's house on friday
 it's in the opposite direction and there won't be time
 what we maybe can do is drop you off there saturday morning

it's a distinct possibility
 is south america a continent
there's north america and south america

 i gotta do something
there's a pizza place right there
they won't let me use theirs
 don't you throw that bottle away
did you get to use the bathroom
 they said it was for patrons only
 i think it has something to do with being in the army
there is this guy who says that men and women are from different planets
 men are from mars
 women are from venus 
 it's just a metaphor
 they came on meteors
take it to the end of the bus
take it to the end of the bus
 i don't want to listen to you cursing
what the fuck 
 i am not talking to you
i don't talk like that
you look like you talk like that
do you ever have to fart really badly in class
 i ate a powerbar and i've had to shit like crazy so i keep farting
but you can't do it in class 'cause then it smells and people know it's you
you can stick dryer sheets in your pants and then it doesn't smell as much
but how do you keep them in there
 if your pants are tight enough
 where they gonna go
or sometimes you can ask to go to the bathroom and when you stand up your ass cheeks squeeze together and you can't fart
but in the two seconds before you're standing you can't control it
 then you fart

if you have hbo
 my favorite movie is on there:

 by the way
 who the fuck is milstein
 you're going to have to move your bags
 it's just common courtesy
 what about the wheelchairs who don't pay
it's not that i have a moral objection to the death penalty
 i just don't think it should be the government making the decision
would you prefer an angry mob
 let me see that football
 are you afraid i'm going to run away with it
she fucks like a puerto rican
have you ever fucked a puerto rican
 but i've imagined it
so she telling me that every year on good friday

so what's that taste like
a dead dog's dick
if anyone messes with you in the office
 just take the palm of your hand an shove it into his nose
 once he messes with you he ain't jerry from accounting no more; he's an assailant and the rest of the office will respect and fear you
how did your last office job work out
 a jesus bus
they must be kidding
 look at them
 i thought people just drove those things around to be funny
it was kind of weird
 she was going down on me and then
she stuck her finger in my butt
 i didn't realize that beth was like that
so what did you do
what could i have done
 it kinda weirded me out
 if my girl ever did that
 i think i'd punch her in the face
 i saw you on the internet
you're like the hundredth person to tell me that tonight
why'd you do that
 throwing that money at me
 give it to me
 why did you throw the money at me
i set it down
 i didn't throw it
why do you have to make it personal
mind your own business
have you been to ground zero yet
you mean the club
 you should try black swan
why don't you be quiet for a little bit
 now if you don't put your coat on
 i'm gonna spank you
 i will tell daddy and he will spank 
 he will not
 nobody spanks me but jesus
why you looking at her
 who is she
 but she's sexy as hell
 she ain't all that
 what she got that i don't got
 a nice ass
 a banging body
need i say more
 you haven't been feeding me lately
you're not a tamagatchi
i can't believe you hang out with that guy
all of your friends are such losers
 i hang out with you
i think that proves my point more than it does yours
well most of your friends are losers anyway
 who cares what they do
 of them's engaged
this reminds me of the time my son caught us having sex in his bed
the second time for my older son
that was the filthiest sex ever
 you need to cut from that side of the meat
 last week you gave me a cut from the right side
 i want a cut from the left side

only way you gonna get a fresher cut of meat is if i take it from your wrinkly white ass
i felt a pop so i looked back and the string had broke
how will you get it out then
 bend over and stick a tweezer up there
 imagine if i can't get it out and i have to go to the hospital
 they'll lock me up
 people get weirder stuff than that stuck up their ass all the time
 like animals and shit
you know whose coochie smells
 don't take this the wrong way: white girls
 white girls' coochie always smells nasty
 every white girl i been with
 their coochie is stank
 it's 'cause white girls live far from the ghetto
 and they have a longass train ride to get to the ghetto
 and by the time they get to your house in the ghetto
 they sweating and waiting and their coochie stinks
i give you jesus
is that mel gibson
there's a six hour minimum wait for a suv
to get a suv
 it's a six hour minimum wait

the guy was standing over my baby shooting a gun; how did i not wake up 
when you're 25 and you measure your hourly rate in three digits it takes a hell of a lot of grief to not make it worthwhile
i woke up this morning
 got on the train
 and i asked
 why was i born so poor
 if you're born into poverty it's because you did something really bad in a previous life
and then september 11th happened and my job prospects were gone
i went on vacation and when i came back i didn't have a job
i'd rather lick that man's ass than go to work today
i was thinking of just taking the day off and masturbating
what i don't understand is why they send someone out on training while everybody else is out on disability
 that just doesn't make any sense
 it's like all three of our neurons are coming together right now
people who didn't go to stuy are random
are those mountains over there
 what are mountains made of
this kinda science is extra stupid and hard 'cause i'll never use electrons and neutrons
 that's why i don't get it
 so they really make you take it out to measure it

my drama teacher said that she looked like she had been fed with a shovel as a child

can i tell you
 i saw the hottest guy on the way to work today
 i think he was coming from work because he was in scrubs
 he was in scrubs and he was just so hot
 so i followed him for a while
 and i didn't realize he was sprinting so i almost got hit by a cab
 but he was just going to get his car
 but i really wish i did get hit by that cab so he could come and save me
 i'm a little embarrassed i was following him
 he was hot
whenever i see someone who looks sluttier than me
 i think i'm doing something wrong
look at all these ugly faces
 these are the ugliest fucking faces god ever breathed life into
welcome to the titanic of airliners

what airline are you on
you don't know what airline you're on
you're sitting on the runway and you don't know what airline you're on
 i won't let anyone know
but what i still don't understand is how some people don't enjoy getting drunk
 but if we're gonna drink
 then i need to get some tampons
peeing while you are drunk is like having a quarter of an orgasm
 please don't buy more beer
he was so drunko he didn't even know he was dead

what did it say
"bush to appoint someone to run country"
 it's just so ignorant
 and to get front page too

so now i feel really uncomfortable whenever i'm around him
 'cause you had dream sex with him
i don't know how i feel about him

 but the thing is
 that i don't think i'm better than everyone
 i i am
 i'm more intelligent

 but i know i'm better than most people
 the problem is when you say that

 they never listen to me because i'm only 18 years old

 i just chose not to respond
but not all asian girls are pretty
 but he just thinks that

 if you wanna be my wife
 you gotta get yourself domesticated
 you have a wife

 you don't know nothing
 they're quaker ghosts; they can't hurt us

i have a life
 and maybe my sister doesn't want to be found
 and if something that bad happened
 they would have come over to the house

 i'm really hungry
you need a dye job
 your roots are showing

 you could hear a rat pissing on cotton
love is just a hornet's nest of emotions
 you're in love
 you want to kill the person they're with
no one else feels this way
they have the most ghetto-ass aquarium ever
 a twenty foot shark in a bathtub
the thing about cronenberg is that you have to appreciate him in
 defrag by watching spice world 
i would rather on my than watch that fucking movie with him
it feels like i'm walking through the matrix
i fucked tony curtis in the ass
 top gun the greatest movie ever
but roger moore be cool while parkin' yo car
 and sean connery be cool while kickin' yo ass
 but there was like
 too much cinematography
i met clive owen once
 at the natural history museum
 he was standing alone in a corner and just started talking to me about sulfur
teen wolf ii was the pinnacle of civilization
so they're paying the kidnappers child support
 i mean i know they want to support their child
 but where is the money going
 to those crazy people
so they actually for you to go to math camp
having kids is not expensive
 it's keeping them alive
 how you gonna charge tax on flowers
 they come from the earth
 from the earth
so then he was like
 "i'll give you 8 million dollars if you let me take a shit on you
" so i told him that he was buggin' and that he need to shut up
 i'll give him a discount
 the "you're-a-thorn-in-my-side-now-just-buy-a-couch-already" discount

 and i left my kids
 but people don't know i'm not eurotrash
 i can't make it that date
 that's the same day as the lay-in for the children of uganda
so i read that article and cried and cried until my mom was
 she was so small i felt like stepping on her
 i can't believe i let that ugly midget provoke me
 the problem is that i'm standing in the
not the express line
 what do you call the other one
 the special people line
 he was so hot
 he's like retarded
 he's been in school for like 7 years
 but he has a perfect body
was he a virgin
 i think so
 he totally needed a new haircut
do you sell tights with feet
 we only sell stuff that's trendy
foods do not make attractive accessories
we are not a society of homer simpsons
homer didn't have food accessories
but don't you think he'd have liked them
 relationships are a lot like the british government
 the queen thinks she's in charge
 but the prime minister has all the power
i wonder if people in the real world are subjected to this kind of conversation
 will you marry me
 wanna get married

what he just say

 my stomach ain't having any of it
it's coming outta ya
do you really have to do that
 you love it
this your first time at the empire state building
 where are you from
i don't want to talk to you
 i can think of plenty better reasons why i shouldn't date him than the fact that we're semi-related
 i don't think a better reason exists than that one
you are really turning it into something that it's not
 the key word here is "semi"
 the key word here is " "
 that really sucks
 so she wouldn't even blow you
 after all that
did she at least finish putting up those shelves in your closet
what kind of trains are those
they're called the path

she bit my neck the other night
she drinks a lot

i wish i could bleach my brain
i find the suburbs to be extremely frightening
 i know they all have air conditioning
the quality of life here is so bad
 if you enjoy drinking all night and having random sex
 you'll like living in new york
 here's the problem
 they don't wan't a baby with a huge head compared to his chest
 nor do they want to see gross veins all over its chest
 they want the fucking gerber baby
all babies look great in black
 did you know that
 now that they've started talking
 the twins are much less creepy
i love you baby
 but i just can't be looking at your face everyday like that
she had that ugly-ass quality about her
you have to help me
 my cock is turning into one of those fucking curly fries
so i told him
 if that's the urethra you got the wrong hole
you don't even how good looking you are
i want your dna
if jesus was with you
 he'd smack you over the head and call you a dick
do either of you have a really nice picture of jesus
 i need to make an ashtray

 he doesn't freeze meat
 it's an issue

 'i love you john*
' and i was like
 "can we just concentrate on the task at hand

 when i was pregnant with my daughter
 i wanted fried food all the time
 this one day
 i left work to go eat some fried fish
 and i ate it
 and i stayed there

 the grease came up and the fish stayed down
we can do whatever you want today
 i just don't like the stuff you make me do that makes me throw up
it's fleet week here
 so i'm getting laid
 without your hat you're fucking ugly
what's with all the little white men
in those little costumes
 don't you just want to jump them
 you're scaring the people
 scare them subtly
we need to stop
 what do you mean stop
 we're in the middle of a tunnel
a door just opened

 pretty much everywhere
so is giving your donkey weed
 but here we are
when he was alive
 now that he's dead
 he gets mail every day
nobody cares til you're dead
 what did you think of the show
 better than going back to hoboken and falling asleep on my couch
everyone who has ever worked there has come back and robbed the place
if it is that bad
 you should call the better business bureau
all the owner does is comp her friends
 do coke in the back
 and think she is successful
so she got really mad at me when i was trying to break up with her
 she was like "you're breaking up with me cause you like me too much
" and i was like "ya
" she just didn't understand

 you're the food maven -- you pick
i don't eat much

 i love sushi
where is suny geneseo
 but where's that

it stands for state university of new york
 how could you not know this
 this is just like that time you tried to convince me spain wasn't in south america
i hate my job
 my boss is a dick
 and if he does not get off my back
 i swear i'll blow that motherfucker up
 man quess what
 i just got a kick ass raise the other week
do you guys remember [becky thatcher]
 i waited on her once
 did you ask her why she burned down that float
why didn't you wear the right shoes
 these are fine
so the whole time you were married you weren't going out with men
but you have to have a baby
 babies are so cute 'cause you can dress them up
 and they are way easier then dogs
you don't have to walk them even

 i've been riding the 4 and the 5 for like
 and no one ever touches my ass
 i don't know
 maybe when it gets warmer you should wear a sarong
 i definitely get felt up more when i wear a sarong
 you think i should tell him i'll sleep with him for that apartment
what is the nastiest thing you can think of
a bloody vagina fart
[chuckling] you know what's funny
 we always manage to notice how much other people stink but we could never gauge how bad we smell
 that's so true
 you said that just to tell me how bad i smell
 what have you been doing
i've just been jogging
 why do chinese people always go jogging in jeans
can you believe he did that to me
 between you and me
and the rest of the train
and i told him
 you wanna gamble
 you got to go to las vegas or atlantic city
 you out there gamblin in brooklyn where they don't give you part credit if you part right
000 in one day
 if you in las vegas
 at least it's still a trip
 go outside and get on the roller coaster
 get some buffet
 but if you in brooklyn
 you still in brooklyn when you done gamblin
what's the weirdest thing you had to do for work

 white on white is 
does this train stop at the next stop
is there any famous person you'd like to see in madame tussaud's who's not here yet
 when's that movie snakes on a plane ever gonna come out

 i think that's a joke too
 what is he
 samuel "the" jackson
just eat your hot dog
 we gonna have a good time today
 you use condoms -- when i do it
 i do it for real
and get the girl pregnant
something called birth control
that doesn't mean you won't get stds
 i make sure she doesn't have stds
but all whores have stds
 and those are the only pussy you can ever get
are both those tuna
this tuna is chicken
 he did a very stupid thing today
 i waxed my whole chest this morning
what should we do tonight
we could pierce something

 so now i gotta put powder on my balls
the makeup lady is finally here
 i need to go get my eyelashes put on
 'cause i feel naked without them
i have a famous ass crack
 i have a famous ass crack
 march issue of vanity fair 
i have so many singles
 i need to go to a strip club
are we really not going to get to see your asshole
 i haven't had a chance to blow him off yet
do you have any friends that don't care about a guy's looks
 but just about his personality
 no i understand
 my sister's the same way
 this kid asks me out and he doesn't have the audacity to even call me
 what is his fucking problem
 you know how upset i'd be if i actually liked him
 it's those shoes you can eat
 can you eat them
 these aren't the edible ones
i like your outfit
 except for the tie; it's awful
 who dressed you this morning
i'm glad i'm not wearing my metallic underwear today
 he was talking about this place 
 and i was like 
 it's not 
 you retard -- it's 
he can't wear no silver shirt
 he'll look like puff daddy
 and i say puff daddy and not diddy because that's
you know what's a growth industry right now
 old lady clothes
 we will be moving shortly
 there is a police investigation taking place on this train
 have a nice day
i always knew they were penalties for not paying your taxes on time
 but i never knew those applied to me
 so this guy is dead
 and they keep driving aruond like a bunch of knuckleheads
i'm gonna go now
 [looks around nervously]
be sure to wash your hands
is dimitri really in jail
 if you find him
 i wanted to wish him a happy birthday
hold your hand up like a antenna
 and maybe your budget-ass phone would work
it took me two years to figure out if it was a man or a woman
 because the head and the feet
 [turns the corner]
 he's pulling down his pants
 he's going to pee
 isn't that where carson daly lives
 did you hear i won an emmy
will the real slim shady please stand up
i'm going out with him and david bowie on wednesday night
so all alan cumming wanted was a bag of weed
 i never want to get married
 but i really want babies
 so i guess i'm just going to have a bastard
 when i found out precum could get you pregnant
 i was so shocked that i hadn't been pregnant
so if you could think about that idea 
and then it exploded and there was semen all over the road
 my problem is that i just can't pay attention for long enough to do my homework the right way
 maybe it's's just the weed talking
 but i'd like to see someone
the sex was better because we were both conscious this time
i have this friend
 she's reaaallly funny
 she takes pills
crackheads gone wild in new york
 how does that even happen
 one more thing
 did you know it takes a pound of pot to get a reindeer off the ground
 catch you later
so she has to get liquored up to go to church
 that can't be what g-d wants
 when you think it's right but it isn't
 then it's like
 i don't know what i'm saying
its similar to that
 not exactly the same as that
 but it's almost similar
why you wanna be a drag queen
 your dick is like 12 inches long and your boobs are as big as dolly parton's
 so we're going to see on the imax tomorrow
 i love that big screen
 i gotta sit in the back
 that screen's too big
 that's one hell of a screen
 filipinos are half chinese and half spanish
 but like more spanish than chinese

 i'm in between
you be the president
 and i'll be the terrorist
 i'm in the bronx

 because everyone on this train is staring at me like i'm a one-woman gentrification bomb

 new york city is being overtaken by taxis
every time i use one of these things i feel like i'm giving money to terrorists

 i get home from work and i eat until about 8:30 but then i have to watch and i don't have time to poop
 i don't even have time to poop during the commercials
i think that movie outsmarted me
 i think the movie won
there are two types of men in this world

 and they own abc
 and a bunch of publishing stuff
 now there's some valuable intellectual property
you stand in front of me
and you stand in back of me
you guys are my stab buffer
 i'm just taking the necessary safety precautions
did you just say "jubble"
 that can't be a real word
there's no such thing as silent onomatopoeia
 the very definition of the word "onomatopoeia" contradicts silence
 it's like the sound that boobs would make if they made sound
 they'd go "jubble
i'm afraid i'm going to have to smack you now
 i'm a scientologist
 what echelon are you in
i sucked his balls for part of the time he shaved me

 it's a fact that weed makes you dumber the day after
 it's also proven that it makes you much much smarter the day after that
so he was at my house and we were like

 and i was lying on top of him
 but then i made him get up
because if he got turned on
 his zipper fell down a little and some come got on my pants and while i was taking off my pants it brushed my underwear and then went inside me
 i could totally get pregnant

is that why they called the volleyball "wilson" in cast away 
 i'm right over here

it's not my problem i can't see you in the dark
 cuz you so black
 the only the thing i can see is your white t-shirt
 but everybody has white on
 there was a man
 out of the days when men could club women over the head and drag them off
what i'm saying is -- my thesis is -- the position i'm taking is -- the argument i'm making is -- there's never been a successful matriarchal society
byron "the whizzer" white
 he was a man
 he could do it all
 feminism is bullshit
 that's what i love about you
 i can't talk like this around most girls
i just got waxed

she start talking about her "boyfriend
 i ain't tryin' to hear about your 'boyfriend
' your boyfriend all that
 how come you here with me
 how come your 'boyfriend' ain't with you now
 how come he ain't helping you move
 no nigger should leave a weepy message like that
 nigger is soft
what language is that
 russian or something
 it might look a little like russian
 but you read it from right to left
 that must be hard
she's at a fuckin' buffet
 she's eating at a buffet
 the fat fuck
 you look better now
 but you were never that skinny
 i never looked at you like "she needs a sandwich"
 but i haven't gained any weight
 really; my clothes still fit
but you were never grotesque
 like what's her name
do you ever have one of those days where you just want to fuck someone up
i'm telling you man
 you don't have to slap the bitch
 you just got to spit on her couple times a week
 you don't wanna leave no bruises cause her moms will fuck you up
 but if you spit on her a couple times
 she'll quit willyin'
 there is a passenger harrassing peeople on the southbound platform
wait -- what was that about the harrassing
 you don't have to worry -- he's on the southbound platform
look at these babes

 it was fucking nasty
why don't you want to go to chicago with him
'cause he got man boobs
i'm scared that i'm going to wake up one morning and be a lesbian

i was down in tijuana getting some dental work done
 and i fell asleep in the chair
 best sleep i ever had
 they should sedate me more often
i couldn't agree more
 this museum is mainly to do with art

 you don't have a knife
i didn't mean violently
 i meant humorously

there's a bathroom right there
i want to my hands

you know it's funny i like to date and have sex with black and italian men
 but i can't eat dark meat
 that is weird
 here were are in wonderful central park
 i thought it was supposed to be bigger than this
 what else could it be
 so lately i've been really getting into african click songs
i can't believe how many immigrants there are
send 'em all back
 what do i care
 your mom an immigrant
 we all came from immigrants
 send 'em back
 for extra credit
 give me two words to describe this day that will go down in history
i'll give you a clue -- it has to do with president bush
 what does tom cruise have to do with bush
 that movie isn't even out yet
 stay white and don't let the black man bite
 stay black and don't take my wallet
so are you doing anything for cinco de mayo
 i guess i'll just go out like regular
 one of my friends knows a ton of puerto rican people
 so that'll be good
you're not my type
what do you mean
 second of all
 you're selling cds on the sidewalk
you see where those turnstiles are
 you're going to make a left there
of course i can't see where the turnstiles are
 i wish i was a bird
so you could fly far
 so i could sit on electrical fences and not get shocked
what are we doing here
 i'm glad the kids are still asking all the right existential questions
you can't have that dog in here
but he's a service dog
 we'll get a ticket if you have a dog in here
he's a service dog
 he's just like a seeing eye dog
 he's not a seeing eye dog
 and he's a service dog
 he even has a little vest
 do you need me to put him in his little vest
he look like a rat with a wig on
he's a service dog
 you can't make me leave
 he's just like a seeing eye dog
but you're not blind
i could sue you if you make me leave
 i'll put him in his little vest
 then you'll see
so my buddy max was telling he how how he hooked up with this puerto rican chick the other night and it was
and it was the best sex he ever had
 you alway fuck up my stories by cutting in
 finish the story
 you already wrecked it
 let's go to delaware
 i've never been there -- i didn't even know it was a state until the quarter came out
 you told me that
 that was like last week
 i am so done with her
 i woke up one morning and looked at her and i knew i was done
 next contestant on my fuck show please

i can help you with that
people can hear you
i would make such a good gay guy
so did you guys end up having sex last night
 we had chinese food

we were just talking
i don't feel well

why are hipster chicks so unattractive
because if they were attractive they would be accused of conforming
 and then they might even have to get excited about something
 screaming profanities isn't going to get you on overheard in new york
but today's our last day in the city and it's my last chance
so you develop tourette's
 stop calling me a tourist
how much is the water

it's time for it
i'm gonna cut off my own toes
it is time for me to get off this train

you're trying to steal my soul
it's just so different from the other south american countries
 it's just -- it's more european
 alex had blue eyes
 there just weren't any
what was that word you just said
 say that again
 there wasn't any of that
the african continent is just with jewish people

 there are too many portuguese people in rhode island
 he's jamaican he's not all there
i am the lord
alice and i are going to dress up like cheerleaders and throw waterballoons full of beer at the crowd
there's a fine line between 'mean' and 'scoring free drinks
to answer your question
 i had a good time last night
 i enjoyed being picked up and spun around
 i didn't like the cigarette burns on my arm
 but other than that
 i had a good time
i don't know if i blacked out
 you guys were drinking when i went to bed
 you were still drinking when i woke up

 and with the help of the lord we're going to abu ghraib all over your face
so he screamed "aaah
 you kicked me in the balls
" and fell over
 and then i woke up

you don't even get naked
 all you do is beat the living shit out of them and be mean and they give you the money
 except my friend that does it said that sometimes she has to eat certain things in advance because some of her customers like her to poop on them
tell me who he is
 i'll slash his tires and overturn his car
why does she have to go and ruin my day
 that's why i need a gun
 you're dead to me
 i hate you
 i said i hate you 
 stop calling me
 stop talking to me

i don't like when they name airports after people
 they should use normal names
 8:30 in the morning and my colon called and said it needed a filling
i'm starting to feel like a democrat
 they just forgot about me

 she wouldn't shut up so i peed on her
just what i would have done
you know that she has learning disabilities
 you know what it means when someone has a learning disability
i should get myself a lawyer
 no one ever tells me anything
 she was sooo busted
 are we talking criminal record or cup size here
 there is this one guy on the show that i'm attracted to
 but i think it's only 'cause he has a lazy eye
i wish you were straight
 i knew i was gay when i was born during general hospital 
 what's with you and candy

this isn't ice tea
 there's no ice in it
 the difference between ice tea and tea is that ice tea is cold
then it's ice tea
but that's not the difference
that's unsweetened ice tea
but look how easy it is to pick out the tourists
 there's a tourist
 there's a tourist
 it's so frickin' easy to tell who belongs here and who doesn't
 like why don't they even try to blend in while they're here
 it's like they're trying to be greek when they're in rome
 'cause when you're in rome
 you're supposed to act roman
 i've never been to italy
 don't touch that
 that's what killed grandma
do you bite your nails
 my girlfriend does it for me
 do you want the post delivered every morning
 i don't know how to read
 i'll read it to you
 i'll come to your crib and read it to you every morning
where the fuck did they come from
 someone took a shit in the sky
new york is a great place to move to
 they say if you can't make it here
 you can't make it anywhere
 that's not what they say
 "if you can make it here
 you can make it anywhere
this girl i used to work with wore too much eyeliner -- she was from the midwest
 she has a smile only a horse could love
 skips around with lots of boyfriends
 threw a birthday party for her dog -- you get the picture
 so she's an ugly midwestern girl who works at goldman sachs in the muni department
 it's not even real banking
i can't imagine sleeping with any of my male friends
you just need to ignore personality

" and he said
 "don't worry about it
 you're very mentally ill
 and it will take you a long time to recover
 "but what am i recovering 
" and he just said
 "don't worry about it
" i still don't know why i was there
 the only reason i can think of is
 i have a terrible temper
 it's not like a human temper
 but it's not like i blew up the world trade center

the cars on this line feel smaller

 my hands are so dirty from being in chinatown
 this city is the dirtiest place on the planet
 if you stuck my hands in a big-ass petri dish
 you better believe there would be some monstrous germs on there the next day
 chinatown smells bad
 like rotten fish
 why is it so hot here
 no one in chinatown has air conditioning
 my pits are so smelly
 but not worse than chinatown
i can't wait until we move to brooklyn heights
 it's the part of brooklyn that says
 "i'm an adult
 not a hipster
 it's the part that says
 "i can afford to live in manhattan
 i just don't want to
is that george w
 it's mayor bloomberg
i was gonna say
 that would be a step up for him
so i don't think the wine looks enough like blood

 i think we could buy it from the blood bank
where do you want to go to college
 you have pink eye
 my brother had that
 it's mad contagious
 how you doing
 i saw your daughter walk past here yesterday

 she's always with a different guy
 i never see her with the same guy twice
 one day i saw her two times in an afternoon
 and she was hangin' all over a different guy each time
 two in the same day
i don't control what she does
 i feel like shit
what if he was seriously hurt
i've been thinking about breaking up with him
 and what if he had died
it'd save you the trouble
dis game aint no thang

this has to be fake
 there's no way any man this small was packing that much heat down there
 did you use to ride horses as a kid

but why can't i play on the slide
because they want to have a fleamarket instead
because some people don't like kids
 it's two outs
 we'll go after this batter
 i want water
you know what i see
 an impatient little boy who can't wait five minutes
you know what i see
 someone who's gonna have their face broken because they didn't have any water
 a naked squirrel
 look like he got burnt or somebody shaved him down the middle
people be eatin' squirrels now

it's a little squirrel torture place somewhere
 somebody done that to him
it'd have to be someone who was raised in the woods
 know how to handle a squirrel
how much will a tenner-worth be
 i think it's fifteen bucks
and that's where mommy is

 it's "i love you
 you got any kids
 what i do don't make babies

 i've been having the shittiest day today
 it has nothing to do with our conversation this morning
 believe it or not
 i can have a shitty day that has nothing to do with you
 i have no idea why i called you
 [hangs up] my fucking dad
 i can't even get a sympathy "it's all rainbows and bunnies" phone-hug from him
i'm looking for something onassis-like
i have to go to a wine-tasting tonight for some charity
 some kind of dystrophy

 he is going to stay in the city
 that truck song is annoying
 the commodification of your desires is annoying
i'm looking forward to using these bath melts i made
 i call them bath melts because "bath bombs" really doesn't seem pc
 why do all the gay guys have to be so hot
 at least all the lesbians are ugly

 is that weird
 i did too
 there was this electric wheelchair woman
 she saw the bus coming and like
 zipped right in front of us so we couldn't get on
 those electric ones
 my body is basically covered with bruises
you mean because of the drinking
 and the violent sex
i've been banging her for four weeks now
 i just found out ty was banging her
 you can take the ho out of the bronx but you can't take bronx out of the ho
what if it's a crime or something
 it's not like you're a rapist or anything
 it's not like you had sex with a little girl
that's the guy's name
it was a term of endearment
a term of endearment is not punching someone in the face
fao schwarz used to be a fun place to hang out
 it doesn't smell the same
my eye won't stop twitching
maybe you should have thought of that before you wiped sarin on the counter
 i just realized that the subway is a bad place to talk about work
 is make-up just for girls
make-up is for girls and really fabulous boys
i'm too black and ugly for you anyways
i swear if one more thing goes wrong
 i'm just going to pull my skirt over my head and 
it's almost enough to make me try women
the alcoholic who waved a shotgun at you on valentine's day
 that's who's taking you to the al-anon meeting
the two guys you slept with -- their friend told me to tell you that he has herpes
don't tell me i don't know about metabolism
 i have known about metabolism my entire life
i don't want to talk about your eating disorder every fucking time we talk
 i can't guarantee that after the circumcision it will look exactly like what you described
i need to see a doctor
 i'm not dying
 but i have a leaking
 it's just active
 it's not inter
 it's so old

 i just can't believe that someone would go to a baptism just to start a fight
 i got kicked out
give me a break
 she's into scat
 she'll eat shit
 but she won't lick some ketchup off my hand
i didn't get spat on
 i wanted to real bad
 but it didn't happen
but you're not fat in america
 take a picture
 someone got stabbed here last night
but we never smelt nothing cause we didn't even know the body was there
she thinks she's so special cause she's pregnant
 try being 35 and not pregnant
 that's harder to do
what do you want lady
 i didn't get you that way
 i'm all alone in my apartment on my bed
 i'm taking my panties off now
 i'm touching myself
 thinking of you
 i'm all wet for you
 i'm wearing suspenders
 i'm revokin' ya hood pass

i can't take the subway now
 it's 10 o'clock
 i'm not black
 all these stabbings and killings
 that's every summer
 i hate the teabag
 i love it
 you've got to embrace the teabag
 is this 42nd street
 have you not lived in this goddamn city for 32 years
 i'm just curious
 just tell me
tell your mother i'm not answering that question
 so how many of the people here do you think have noticed that we're high
 five of them
there are only five people in the store
 all of them
 you just wouldn't understand
 that guy just dropped his ipod under the train
he's not even crying
he must be in shock
 i would be
 i guess your ass got off the island
have a happy father's day
happy father's day to you
 maybe in saigon
 i figured out what happened
 ebony was at the drug house with the first lesbian
 but then that other lesbian that she stole two dollars from came
 so that's where you came in
 are you there
 what do you really want out of life
besides hardcore sadomasochistic sex
people are totally listening to this conversation
 they're really not
i can't believe that cvs didn't have paint
 how about bagel art
 that place should have paint
that says bagel mart
move a little to your left
 so then what does it have
how much does he want
 i'd rather drag my friend home on her face than pay you ten dollars
 satan's children are walking the streets
shut the fuck up
 go sit in the back of the fucking bus
will you take $20 for that bag
 you've got nerve
 i'll pray for you
pray that someone is stupid enough to pay more than twenty bucks for that plastic piece of shit
this car is stolen
what the fuck you talking about
i got a stolencarreport on my phone about this car being stolen
 you about to get your phone stolen
i've been in this neighborhood for so long
 see that brownstone
 ago i was invited to a wedding reception there
 it was awesome
 i was sitting right up front and laughing and crying with the rest of the family
 i love you ladies
 to this day
 i still don't know how the hell i got there
 or who those bitches were
the yogurt won't fall
thank god that's over
let's get out of here before the whole thing collapses
i wish that dad was here
 because the fat fuck owes me a thousand dollars
 we need you right away
 don't talk to me like i'm some kind of normal person
i hear people in third world countries are so hungry they eat people
 whether they have a conscience about it
 i imagine they don't eat their own children
 probably just someone else's
 it would be easier to do that
 i totally agree
wanna drink some nigga juice tonight
are you sure you feel safe walking back by yourself
 i usually don't get harassed this much
 i think it's just because there are two of us
 that's 5 years
 you'd be like a pedophile
it's not like i'm looking for a relationship
 i just wanna bone
i need to bring you to church
 you need every kind of religion there is
 i have got to poop
would you please just crap in your pants and quit screaming about it already
let me ask you something: a lady sits down next to you on the train and you keep inching towards me
 when a lady sits down
 you inch towards her
 why are you inchin' towards me
 what's wrong with new yorkers
 all scared of women
but you don't wear underwear
 and you were wearing a see-through top
 that's totally not the point
i don't know if my sister is a lesbian or not
i thought she was
 but the other day some guy was like
 your sister dated nick for a long time
 and now all i know is that she's dating someone who makes omelettes
 omelettes are manly
why do you watch so much king of the hill 
 i guess i just like texas history
to all the men on the train
 happy father's day
 and to all the ladies on the train who wear two hats
 happy father's day to you
taco bell is fifty cents
 but i don't want to go to taco bell for a date
have you noticed that if you say "taco bell" enough
 it starts to sound funny
 it sounds like a battle of the civil war
the battle of taco bell
 where are we
what are we doing here
looking at handsome gay guys
because they're more fun than straight guys
 and they like it when you look at them
so did you ask your mom if you can go to the party or not
 she said yes
 but she made me promise to not come home this time with no pants on
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
 and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee
are you trying to mug me or what
 could you please move your bag so i could sit down
 can't you see i'm busy
 and i'm not movin this fuckin' thing
 it's heavy and i don't want to pick it up again
 sit somewhere else
the key to divine love and inner peace 
i was just at the spot and there was no car
 i know what a car looks like and it wasn't there
 are you sure it was a white lexus
 it wasn't there
 i got eyes
 well then fuck off and go buy your own damn drugs
is it disgusting that i think pregnant women are sexy
like that woman there
 that round belly makes me want to come all over her face
 that is disgusting
so when i started telling him my feelings on the iraq war
 he rolled over to me in his wheelchair and started cursing me out
 he was going on about his time in vietnam and how there are things about war i'll never understand
 you're my shrink
 i'm paying to listen to 
 at least the co-pay was only $15
 i'm definitely not going back to him
is there a specific exhibit you'd like to see
 i want to see the dinosaurs
there are many africans where i live
 i like them
 because they're more spiritual
they're closer to nature
 let's go watch the world cup
 we'll see witchcraft
 that stuff from harry potter
but also chuck norris
 that's a given
 i just like saying his name
gives you a little rush
you don't know the half of it
is it true that mexicans carry knives
shut up before i bust into a stereotype on your ass
 can i jump off and be naaaaaaacho
you already broke your arm
 you can't be nacho right now
you have to just ask him
 but you have to ask him to his face so you can see his reaction
 just look him in the eye and say
 are you on match
" and see if he looks surprised
 you just have to confront stuff like that
it doesn't mean anything
 it's just green paper
 it doesn't mean anything
then why don't you throw it out
 [throws bill onto subway tracks] if it means so much to you
 why don't you go get it
 that was five-dollar bill
 it's so great to run into you
 i haven't heard from you in so long
 that's because you didn't call me after we slept together
 we should get tattoos
i find those people
 to be low class
but we are low class
you look like vanna white
don't she look like vanna white
what do you mean better
 vanna is rich and shit
 and on tv
 and this bitch over here has nothing
 she's on the subway
 for christ's sake
what's he wear now
 now he likes to wear button-down shirts with cufflinks
that probably looks much better
 his face is way too brown to be goth
is this the way to the subway
 you need to go west of 49th
can i go down there anyway
 there's a special event
 we're from california
 welcome to new york
so it's my beer pong table
 if we ever break up
 i get the table
 half of it
 if you're going to cut it in half
 you can have it
 i don't want to see the table ruined
 i care about beer pong that much
 it's like the judgment of solomon
you guys know what herpes are
herpes are what you get from whorehouses
 they look like
you know pretzel sticks with salt
i haven't seen that guy with the toupee on the train since i said something
do you think he heard you
 maybe he committed suicide
 do you know if the liquor store's still open
 what are you excusing me about
 take-a off the pant
and that's why we respect our elders
you never wear earrings
but that's why we have ears
 to get them pierced
 we have ears so we can hear
 you make no sense
 what do we do
 it's a joke
 i need a whole six-pack
 do you see the lips on him
 jeter's so hot
 tino was the hottest of them all
 even that knoblauch was cute
 i'd sleep with any of the yankees
 but you know
 i'd draw the line at yogi berra
 is there anything wrong with you
 do you have horns
have you ever been in jail
 i've been in jail
you as an individual have to decide what is right for you as an individual
you have to decide as an individual whether or not you want to turn yourself in
 she stop right in front of me
she just slammed on the brakes
 why did she do that
 light was yellow
 green is go
 red is stop
 yellow is go faster
 you eating white castle
 these is good
 i love them
guess you won't be loving them when the next time you take a shit
 your liver comes out too
 why you hatin' on white castle
so how do i get that pre-freshman to give me a handjob
do you realize that you're graduating from college soon
 and you're asking me this
you cut in front of him because he's black
 i just didn't see him
you didn't see him because he's too black
so i got some of that topical headache medicine
 the cream that comes in a giant chapstick tube so you just rub it on your head without getting it on your hands
 i don't know if it worked
 i got so much of it in my eyes that i had to spend the rest of the night in the emergency room
 let's go in that one
 that one is for boys
 you can't go in there until you're 25 and at a bar and you really have to go
 85th and 2nd
 that mexican is hungry
i'm the delivery boy
 you dumb fuck
and to make matters worse
 she stole my bag of weed
she told you she had herpes
 and you're worried about your weed
i can't believe they're making a live action movie
 i will definitely go see it
are you even old enough to remember 
 i'm only three years younger than you
 but that doesn't mean you were old enough to be conscious of 
 my brothers are your age and they don't remember the show that well
you do realize every time you ask me that it doesn't make me seem young
 it just makes you seem old
where are you from
 could you hear our accents over there
 it's because in new york we know that you can't bring dogs into restaurants
 we work for the department of public health
 consider this a warning
 i thought it was ok because y'all are ok with paris hilton and all
 you almost hit that nice lady
 then she would have sued you and took all your playstation games
 don't touch that
 you have ringworm
 that looks like metallic vagina sculpture
i would like to see something a little bit more modern
 this isn't modern enough for me
 too much marijuana
 too much cocaine
you're not following the diet plan
 it's either junk food or food
move to the back of the bus
 they're giving free diamonds in the back of the bus
 see that lady in the back for your free diamond
i hate this city
 you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a production
you know my ex-boyfriend
 you remember him
 his sister was in jail with amy fisher
stop singing joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat 
 that's all i'll ever ask of you
 i have been so gassy lately
 i found this guy i thought i'd fix you up with
 but i talked to elliot and he said he wouldn't cross the street to piss on him
 he's an ethical scumbag
 i that's what everybody says about elliott
my son's favorite color used to be red
 because his father is a blood
 but i've gotten him out of that
 now it's blue
 and his father is going nuts
but why does your mom want to get so many tattoos
i just fell asleep
 it's not like i'm seeing other people
you told me you was a celebrity
 i sucked yo dick
 i told him
 the closest you're getting to getting me from behind
 is licking your own balls and humping my leg
i'm blacker than the fucking poops you shit
 where'd all these white people come from
 i like to make happy with the pretty girls
 but not the pretty girls
if she had broken up with me before the end of the school year
 i would have had a shot at nailing all of her friends
keep your legs closed and your books open
 my mommy says a girl can get a boyfriend and then she has to drop out of school
i ain't gonna take that shit
 i'm gonna fuck that nigga 'til a nigga come outta me
out in la they're into that whole fake boobs/ann taylor thing
of course you do
 that fits into your preppy short girl fetish
 which i'm not
do you have a dollar
may i have it
shouldn't you do a trick first
 i don't even own pants
 you want me to dance for that shit
 i'm about to walk into the subway
 i'm gonna lose you
 i just wanted to tell you that my parents are gonna be there tonight
 and i know you didn't want them to see your tattoos the first time they met you
 so i wanted to tell you so you could
 i cannot believe i just did that
 her mother had no idea she has tattoos
i don't see the big deal
 so she has tattoos
 did you say her last name was goldstein
 i get it now
 but i think he's gay
he asked me if my carpet matches my drapes
i don't think he's gay
call him up and tell him he can chew on your carpet
 the kitty pushes the others around
 he's a real tyrant
 guess what she named him: osama
 you ain't gonna live to be my age if you keep goin' around callin' people assholes
shut the fuck up
 i don't have to listen to you
so if i got the first season
 you would watch it with me
 it's the fucking golden girls 
 i saw uma thurman in les mis 
she wasn't in les mis 
she wasn't in les mis on tv
i thought it was her
 or someone else with that cross-eyed look
when is the puerto rican day parade
 don't people get gang-raped at those things
 i am a gentleman
my ass is killing me
 mine feels alright
 you weren't doing what i was doing all day
 it feels like someone ripped my ass off and stapled it back on
i don't like german shepherds
 they scare me
because they bark loud
 that is scary
 but the real reason is the nazis used them in the holocaust
 so i don't like them
 can you get floyd to sign something for me
 floyd hates kids
 your doggy is soo adorable -- i just want to eat him
 [to her friend] is that the most endearing thing she could come up with
i think she's mexican
 she can't be mexican
 i've been there
 they cute but short
 now that you mention it
 she is a little too tall to be mexican
 but i don't care
 i'll still hit it
i'll hit it and help her get her papers if she doesn't have them
 i'm all for amnesty in the name of getting laid
i wanna sleep here
 just because i wanna sleep outside of doc holliday's doesn't make me a bad person
i wanna sleep here
 don't ever make me get up
you can not sleep outside of a saloon in alphabet city
 that makes you trash
 sleeping on the streets makes you trash
 would you please get up
 but you better find me some drugs
what kind of italian restaurant doesn't have chicken parmesan on the menu
 what kind of pizza is that
who do you think would win a fight between ann coulter and maureen dowd
 a death match
i'm gonna go with ann coulter
 they both wear long
 they could put each other's eyes out pretty fast
but ann coulter would be like
 i'm in a death cage
" and maureen dowd would be like
 what am i doing in a death cage
shit i didn't know brooklyn was this advanced
isn't that the water street dorm
we didn't quite make it off manhattan
i don't want vegetarian pate

 in new york most people aboveground get where they're going by walking
 the sidewalks are the main roads in the city
if you were driving on a busy road
 you wouldn't just stop or take random turns in traffic without checking your mirrors or signaling
how do i signal
 it's the smart people not having kids
 or maybe having one or two
 its the uneducated that are reproducing more uneducated people
 you know that 64% of kids born today are minority

 i think it will be a really nice experience for me
 i love jews
 i'm not just saying it to get into your pants
he probably met her in darfur

 christy works with three people who are getting sex changes
 but she works at a vegan restaurant

do you enjoy sitting on women
 it depends on how old they are
i wish they had a whole pizza made of crust
 i would so buy it
the freshman at stuyvesant are more attractive than the sophomores this year
that's because they lowered the standards for them last year
 and dumber people are obviously way hotter than smarter ones
watches -- five dollars
 what's the catch
they'll never catch me
 why did newsboys used to shout "extra
" when they'd sell papers
 maybe the news was about
 i don't even want to think about it
of course you think it's gross if you call it that
 you got the boys gone crazy 
 girls gone crazy
so you think you can get me financing for the car
 i could get a horse thief financing
so the guy actually steals horses
 where do you meet these people
i haven't had a regular check up in years
 but i've had about five mris
 there's a lot going on in my head
 everything but a full head of hair
 not gonna let me graduate
what if you give them money
 my school's a capitalist machine
 they'll let you get away with murder if you pay them enough
 then you're screwed
 they're too used to kids pulling knives on them for extra pencils
 you can get anything you want by crying
 works for me
 can i borrow your nirvana cd to burn
 my ipod erased my mp3s
i wish i had it

i could always shoot your old ass
 and have the soda for free if that makes making change any easier
i wanna have like 15 kids all by the same woman
my grandmother had 16 kids
 that's a real woman
 i want to marry a real woman
 it's her again
who is this lady
so what nationality are you
 where is scandinavia
it's just sore gums
 probably from flossing
 no need to worry
but it could get infected
 and i could die
has anyone ever died from this in the history of mankind
 but you could also walk out of the hospital and be hit by a bus
 you have a better chance of that happening
so you're saying i could die from this
 and i shouldn't leave the hospital
 i just wanted to let you know i'm just coming out of a relationship
 then i should tell you that i used to be a stripper in chicago
 i have two cats

awwww i'll mail you some real ones for your bar mitzvah
if my wife looked like you
 i would stop smoking crack and get a job
i am able to diagnose psychological issues very accurately because i used to suffer from them myself
 your typical goth girl will have below-average self-esteem
 girls who dance with their hands above their heads or who are obsessed about their purses date a lot and also suffer from low self-esteem
what did you do this weekend
they have bob marley's last burrito -- just like the other place we went to
didn't he only have one last burrito
why would someone tell you that right after meeting you
 why can't you just say your favorite movie is the lord of the rings instead of lord of the rings porn

 as long as i know she's still a virgin
that's what the tourists use to look at us

 how the hell am i supposed to find it
 you'll find it
it's a big fucking park
 i remember him
well i'd hope you'd remember him after he stuck his finger in your butt
i just don't get it
 he said they were just friends
 but they were always hanging out
 then all of a sudden he dumps me
 you've been jolie'd
 i'm telling you
 he couldn't eat the trix because he was an rabbit
 and trix were only supposed to be for kids
 i always thought it was just because he was a rabbit and not a person
i'm just really getting tired of you always being wrong

 together forever" on your phone
 when i turned it on right now
 my ass; now shut up

 his body couldn't fit out of my vagina

i don't think the country of nicaragua bases its sense of identity on my sexual exploits
is long island a state
 everyone here loves you
everyone here loves alcohol
what's that really fast train called
 that's allergy medicine
i think elvis died on my birthday
 elvis died on madonna's birthday
 why do i always get that confused
 we are staying at the bellagio
 that gives us instant credibility
but he didn't get shot
 the old man's dead
 guess what i dreamt about last night
 i dreamt i was dead
 i'd rather do it for a dead person than a handicapped one
i don't want you to freak out about this
 but when i die i want you by my side
i have to sleep with her before she gets married
i want the wedding without the husband
 i want to wear the dress and have a party all about me
 "don't you want to marry me
" and i was like [shrugging]
 "why the fuck not
i can't believe you can't spend three hours to come to my wedding so you can study for the bar exam
 i'm your sister
 and this is my first wedding
 so it's really important to me
if i had known how much work marriage was gonna be
 i would've said
 "fuck the cow
 give me the milk for free
 they're past the murder-suicide part of their marriage
 so that's good
hold on to the pole
 but keep your tongue away from it
 don't eat the watch
 but it doesn't taste good
take your muffin outta the box
 if it goes through the machine
 it'll give you radiation
 life's a disappointment
 walk or die
 walk or die
everyone wants to be tan
 what do you mean
 what do you mean your audition is gonna be in a bathroom
and a urinal cake is worth fifteen points
sex just isn't the same when you're constipated
so i just said to him
 i have to go now
 i have diarrhea
diarrhea is like the anti-aphrodisiac
did you just say that you had a dream where gene wilder peed in your closet
 pissing on your clothes
 i just wanted to make sure i heard correctly
 i wouldn't piss on someone if i didn't know them
 you fucking cunt
 work the damn door
 big fucking place like this
 they got only one bathroom
 i am fucking pissing on the floor
 i will piss on the damn floor
 that's my fucking right as an american
 i'm a patriot
 that's an adverb
 riegell told me in third grade if you have a syllable you've got an adverb
 and i got a damn syllable
 i'm pissing on the fucking floor
will i accept payment in what
 i won't accept an eight-ball as payment
 i don't care how pure it is
 the only coke i do comes in five dollar rocks
 i can't afford to get hooked on that expensive shit
prefers the expensive shit
the reason i'm buying all of this coke is so that we can fuck
can you imagine saying your vows when you're that coked up
 she took a picture of me one time while i was doing a line
 and i was
america runs on cocaine
i just want to buy some fucking groceries so we don't spend all our money on coke
all we're gonna do anyway is drink in my basement
and he was like
 "you people from connecticut
 all you ever do is drink cocktails and text-message each other
like the herbal tea of beers
 you can't get married
 you're going to college
 there's gonna be a lot of girls and beer
 every day 
what do you mean she's not drunk yet
we're going to strap the beer to the dog
 and go down to the ho chi minh trail
 and camp out by the railroad tracks
i would rather be poor and not famous than famous and poor
i drank a lot today
 but i am not drunk
did you do her
 here's the plan: we paint your van
 then you have sex with susan
 then i'll have sex with
 then we both smoke a of weed
 i just stopped smoking weed
 i heard it was bad for you
 so i started smoking cigarettes again
 i told you i quit
 that was just me blowing my bangs out of my eyes
i read somewhere that if you quit smoking by the time you are middle aged your body can still recover
 and i thought
 "great i still have a couple more years to quit
" then i read what they define "middle aged" as
 you cannot smell my armpit
 having knees doesn't make you special
 i'm gonna squat on her brain
did your brain fall out
his teeth are really straight
 but that's because he was home-schooled
every time a girl sees my teeth
" i'm gonna get this whole shit redone
 where they take them all out and replace the whole thing
 it costs like $20
only thing is you have to go two months without any teeth
 you have very nice legs
 have you ever thought about doing voice-overs
who wants to play guess which body part am i fidgeting
so when you said you loved her
 did you say you loved her booty
your mama's booty is gonna come in handy tonight
 you know i want tarzan the musical to be a giant flop
maybe these crackers be famous
 but it's broadway
 this shit sucks
 we're going to see the directors the directors the directors 
 the directors 
 i mean the producers 
that's a real cute phone for a nigger without a job
 if i had that much money
 i'd spend it on something else
 like pants made of diamonds
or hookers made of gold
you're a fucking moron
 wasting all your money on that shit
 if you know anyone who
 anyone to do
 anything for money
 i'm totally desperate
 i'll totally let you know
 he was pissed
 she swallowed his cousin's babies
 but she wouldn't swallow his
that ain't true love
 there is six hundred feet of train
 let's try to use more than one door
well that was rude
we were trying to name all fifty states
 and i was like
 "is delaware a state
" and then three other people asked the same thing
maybe i'll take you to lucky cheng's
i thought you'd heard of it
 men dress up as women there
 they're called transvestites
 some of them even have had surgery
 i won't really take you there
 i just wanted to understand your thought process
 see how you react when i throw something like that out there
 are you taking me there
so i was watching this thing on tv about nelson mandela
i don't remember him
 didn't he used to be a host on mtv
so i think i lost my favorite jeans
 the ones that make my ass look small
 you can't lose something that doesn't exist
 aren't you david copperfield
will you do a trick
you must have pulled something out of a hat to get in here
i think that's just so ridiculous that they would expect you to teach these kids when you don't know the kids at all
well they had name tags
did you see that italian lady offer me her seat on the subway
 it's the shirt
 this fucking expensive shirt makes me look pregnant
so don't wear it anymore
 it was expensive
 i'd rather look like a well-dressed
 knocked-up slut than a single girl with sub-par taste in clothing
i find it tart
 also kind of musky and a little sweet
 are you talking about pineapple or pussy
 can you tell me how to get to baltimore
i think it is better to be born with no legs than to be born with two and have them taken away
she think she know everything
 if he love her so much
 why'd he go get that other girl pregnant two months after she lost her leg
 he should be giving a baby
it doesn't matter how many people i've had sex with
if i can remember each of their names
 then it isn't a lot
you had a threesome with the mayor of 
 it's like the apples did every other fruit in the garden
and after the party
 everyone gets innoculated and takes the morning after pill
the problem is that men are paradoxically both a reason to be celibate and to have large amounts of sex
my sister had a kidney removed when she was 9
 and she still uses it
 the only reason i have kids is that
 if i ever need it
 i know there's a compatible kidney around
if i wanted to be angry
 i would have punched you in the face a long time ago
sometimes the most spiritual fucking thing to do is punch somebody in the face
it's not like someone put a gun to your head and told you to fuck her
 i'm interested in your sparring class
 you see i want to hit somebody
 i don't care if you a girl or not
 i will bust you in the head with a rock
then he peer-pressured me into being morbidly obese
nothing's bigger than oprah
 not even my mother's ass
new york sports club
 only 37 dollars
 get yo' fat ass to the gym
 i'm sick of all the fat girls in coney island
it's not cheating if she's fat
 now she's just going to make fun of me because i'm short and fat
 oh my god
 i guess she must really like that swan
she was real "helen of troy" pussy
 thinking about going to the movies
 maybe i'll see the devil in miss prada 
yeah i sold my soul to the devil
 i was like
 can i sell you my soul
" and he was like
 we all know that the devil does not wear prada
 he wears flame-retardant knock-offs from target
and then the tourists paused near the construction of the new york times' new building
 who was i guess their leader
 pointed to it and said
 that's ground zero
and this is h street
 so we'll be in soho next
 i think that's times square
 i'm in the times square area right now
 is this times square
does this train go to manhattan
 are we in manhattan or just new york
could you tell me how to get back to manhattan
 ya goddamn farthole
and i'm just gonna take a shit in his fucking mouth
 do you hear me

 she wasn't a better person before she went to rehab
 just a more fun one
 it would be awesome if she relapsed
 we are terrible people
i really never cared for skiing
 but i was so alone in my marriage
 i found it was a great way to meet men
 want to go to a ballroom club
and they kept talking shit about gay people
 those people should be lynched
 i told you to stop talking about lynching in this neighborhood
my ex was such a wuss
 he even sucked his thumb
 thirty years old and he sucked his fucking thumb
 my ex had a little pillow on his bed that said
 "princess sleeps here
didn't buy that for him
if you're so bored
 go play in traffic
 tell that bitch i'm crazy
 i'm mad crazy
 not that crazy on the train shit
 i'm crazy goin' ta' jail shit
but he's so funny when he's not having seizures
that's why i ejaculated in your mom's nose
 i don't like the idea of drinking semen not directly from the cock
he took me to a japanese restaurant
 i got the chicken karaoke
 is alabama kentucky
the himalayas aren't a real place
 they're like narnia
in british whose line is it anyway
 do they speak english
my doctor told me if you piss right after sex
 you can't get stds
 i do it all the time
 you had a dream that you had aids
 that had aids
i know it's sick
 but i'm so excited that i can have unsafe sex now
 i don't know if this is a trans-generational or new york metropolitan faux pas 
 but you should really tell your friend
 lady friend or whatever that one in every four persons in america has herpes
we have to make out tonight
 and we have to get it on camera
i felt so uncomfortable so
 i had to get wasted
my parents just don't know me anymore
 i've changed my last year in new york
 i've had sex with a lot of people
 but you have to bring a leather outfit
 otherwise you won't get any clients
 everyone there is a biker or otherwise they are latex fetishists
i used to have two vibrators
 but i broke 'em both
 so long islanders will be there
 you know what that means: debauchery
he had the nerve to tell me that i had no life
 i was like
 "i do too have a life
 i am drinking constantly
 in case i get thrown in jail tonight you have the money for bail
they said i'd be looking at a $10
000 fine and six months in jail
 but they didn't take my name
 i figure if people aren't out wandering the streets looking for me
 but did he really just get out of jail
 mountain lions are cowards
well don't ask me
 i don't know anything about the mechanics of whale sex
please enter the train as human beings
 not wild animals
yeah that reminds me of my first time
 he took me to dinner but was too nice and perfect
 then in bed he made animal noises and his cat was like between us and he didn't kick it out of bed
so i woke up with a slice of pizza on my stomach again last night
you know my theory: ground beef makes anything taste better
give me a donut
 but not a very sweet one
"butter lovers" or "x-treme butter" with an x
i had frosted cheerios for breakfast
 that's some heavy shit
i had to call you
 guess what i'm thinking about right now
 you know the little peanut man on the jar of peanuts
 the little peanut man
here's what i want you to do
 i want you to spread chocolate on my chest
 i want you to spread some nougat
 then some caramel and roasted peanuts
 then i want you to fuck me and call me snickers
i slipped and fell and slid about fifteen feet on 34th street
 thank god i have a fat ass
 it was like a slip 'n slide without the warm
 the bathing suit
 or the fun
that was like the time my sister got hit by her own school bus
i don't wanna see any foreign shit
he's only barking because he isn't used to seeing that kind of dog
so i was watching one of those independent channels
 and i saw this weird movie called jesus christ superstar 
 have you heard of it
 it's from the 70's
 so the camera work is really bad
 but it's not in black and white or anything
 the best part is that herod is all big and fat and he sings this funny song
 "you're the king of the jews
" it's a pretty funny movie
 kill jesus at the end
 i don't think jesus ever asked mary magdalene to kiss his balls
jesus saved me already
 you fucking cunt
 i could've annihilated jesus at beer pong
 the only ass i kiss is jesus christ
 you won't believe it
 i'm on a bus
 in new york city
 can you imagine
 i am psyched to be in new york
 i can't believe they have sand here
 i love this city
 if new york had a cunt
 i would eat it
 they're star jones
and they're as black as her soul
i wouldn't want to work at a minimum-security prison
 those people scare me

how do i cross the parade
get in line with the rest of the straight people
 14th & 5th
that kid just pulled up the mannequin's skirt and copped a feel
 kid's mother pulls down the mannequin's skirt

 what is that
 i think you get it from chickens or something
my mom has chickens
does she have bird flu
 she has eggs
 what's that smell
my brother tried to fuck my girlfriend 
 and she hates him for it
 some girls have no sense of humor
they take your children
they even take your dignity
i think they give them a class on it
 how to be a complete asshole and sleep with all of your girlfriend's friends
i don't wanna talk to you
how many times must i tell you
 i don't sleep with guys
 look at what that guy is wearing
 brown shoes with no socks
 he can do that
 nobody can get away with that
 he can do that because he's
 from new york
i got mad depth perception
 do you know what that means
 i can see really good out one eye
 deaf means you can't hear shit
 it smells like someone made a dump
so my mom bought some 100-calorie packs of oreos because she thought that they were just small in size
 but it turns out that they have no cream

i don't know where and i don't know what
 but i am getting something pierced
i just want to throw a rock at it and watch all the windows shatter
they're basically a bunch of shitty myspace kids with mutant powers
 like the hedgehog kid: his power is that spikes come out of his body
 what the fuck is that
 i could roll around in glue and syringes and get that guy's power
i think vampires are kind of stupid
 they seem to care an awful lot about how they look and what others think
 you're six hundred years old and on your way to hell
one of my cousins is a dragon
 i bought this shirt

 he owes me fucking ten dollars
this is really gay
you know why i wear this shit
because i love the stare
 i love it when some dumb white guy stares at me and asks why i wear this so i can curse the shit out of that mothafucka

 a friend of mine took all my drugs
 then i went to her place
 and i said

" so she gives me this one bottle
 and later i go in her bathroom
 and i look in the medicine cabinet
 and they're all right there
 why would she leave them there
 she had to know i'd just go in there and take them back
and later i went to a party--you know
 that rooftop party--and someone stole all my oxycontin
i was just kidding
 i've had a stressful day
i really wish we had stayed
 i totally would have waited in the rain and gotten wet for beyonc&eacute;
i didn't know you were into chicks
wet from the rain

 keep cool out there
it's too hot for stupidness
you think this is hot
how you been doing in this heatwave

guess who i interviewed today
 this guy got sent to jail twice for sodomy
i had to call him back after i read that
but at least he's not
 a thief or something
 i bet those two tear drops were for the guys he fucked
it wouldn't look good on your job application if you got arrested

 and then he grabbed my head
 pulled it down
 and licked my bald spot
 he did just pee on me
 if you're there
 oh my god
 i just hooked up with a guy whose house smelled like cat pee
 and he wanted me to spit in his face
 where the fuck are you

 you're making me feel awkward
 there's no answer
 she must be whipping now
i like it when he hits me
 i hit him just so he could hit me back
 i like it rough
she just told me a story about someone waking up with a dildo in her mouth

 she must be out of her mind
 just give me a fake one
 something at hotmail
so i am thinking about creating another website that's jedi-friendly
 where's my sudanese pussy from chinatown
i'll meet you at the corner by the store with chinese writing

 then dracula's native language would be hungarian rather than romanian
 and i think that is important for my research
this bag is mad aztec

mexico is not a third-world country
 you can tell he's mexican by his eyes

he looks like traditional representations of jesus
me and jesus don't get along
 our periods stopped at the same time for two hours so we could have sex and i was like
 god loves me
 jesus was clearly gay
 you can't go switchin' churches like that

 that's how white they was
you see that guy over there
 you see how he's a different color than you
 you see that sometimes in big cities

 we gotta stop acting so black
we never gonna get a cab unless we start hangin' with some white folks
but bob dylan is jewish
 that's kind of black

that woman's not pregnant; she's just real old
you don't understand why i'm upset when

this baby stuff is boring
i swear to god
 if some girl i was fucking got knocked up
 i would kill myself
 i would kill myself and then i would punch her in the face
 if she got pregnant
 i would tear that baby out with a fork

 i could hit you over the head with a fucking rock
so i had an 8:45 meeting with a congressman today that i totally forgot about
 it's like 8:50

" such a bitch
 and the thing is
 she's not even cute
 she has no right
 she's a fucking bitch
 and she's ugly
 it's one thing to be a bitch
 but to be one when you're ugly
 you just don't do that
i don't know what i'd do if i had a kid and it was ugly
 i'd probably die of embarassment or something
 maybe i should adopt
 ask the adoption people to give you a good-looking child or something
we will be dimming the cabin lighting
 as it greatly improves the attractiveness of your in-flight crew
 so [the doctor] says you're ugly
 she accused me of being mean
 she insulted this new dress i was wearing at the party and was all like
 "ew that is so ugly
" which was kinda bitchy

 homeless black guy to think you're hot

 put those vicious
 ass-grabbing lesbians behind bars
i think i could totally be a lesbian
except for the whole
 lack of penises thing
if i ever went to a drag bar
 i'd never want to draw attention to myself
 but two 400-pound lesbians
so tell me what those lesbian meetings are really about
i think a lesbian counts for two gay people because they're rare
come play shoot the freak

do you see the color of my skin
 i'm obviously more intelligent than you
it was so diverse and
 i don't know
 i felt like a minority
i don't discriminate based on race
 but you in particular are a suspicious-looking motherfucker
 you should have been there to see my husband naked-bodysurfing
 --thompson & spring
 i'm just calling to let you know the naked cowboy called in sick today because of the rain
 i'm going to take his place
 i just wanted to let you know
 --48th & 2nd
it's not like when a guy sees you naked
 he's gonna be like
 i wish you were more muscular
you still love me even though i'm a fatty
 i could totally fall in love with her if she weren't such a crack-whore
shrooms are like love and happiness
 you don't find them; they find you
if he really loved me
 wouldn't he moisturize
love ain't got nothin' to do with the way you smellin' right now
but if she loved me so much
 why did she point the shotgun at me
you know that susan already hates you
of course she's just doing it to be a bitch
this one is for tobacco
 they don't do pot
 why do chip manufacturers always put the crumbs at the bottom of the bag

 it totally tasted like weed
 --lafayette & houston
last night we were so wasted we got naked and mounted the ram
and then watched fraggle rock 
watching dawson's creek is like studying for the sats
 a refrigerator with a television in it
 my life's dream has just been realized
it's not called because they're lost
 it's called because the audience can't follow it
but if you don't have a television
 how do you watch porn
let's be honest: everyone knows he has the personality of an air conditioner
it's times like this i wish i carried a taser
he smell like a sanitation truck
 you know how when a sanitation truck drives by and it just smells nasty
 he like 8 trucks in a row
 that girl over there is a great artist
 she did a fantastic job of drawing her eyebrows on her face
tourists are kinda like retards; i want to help
 but i just never seem to
i don't want no broke ass bitches
 she couldn't even rub two crackers together
 table 9 has had so much work done on her face
 too bad she still look busted
 what i don't think you understand is
 his parents are his mother and a pimp
i don't want to be sold for five dollars on the street
this company needs a hit like a crackwhore on payday
i don't think he's addicted to porn
 but i think he does
 coke off hookers' asses
i couldn't tell if they were singers or prostitutes
so then the hooker walked in with a squeegee
 then i knew it had gone way too far
she's kind of the president of the prostitute guild
you know that anton webern's quartet for the end of time was performed in a concentration camp
 he died real weird
 i forget how
 i think the nazis shot him
actually he was shot by allied soldiers
 he was breaking curfew smoking a cigarette
 and they mistook him for his brother-in-law
 who was an alleged nazi spy
 i just ride this train all day waiting to answer questions on twentieth-century music composition
 the next car has an expert on chekhov
 and the conductor studies philosophy
 slavic girls are pretty hot
i call her a dirty slag
 she calls me a fat cow
but she says it in the most proper british accent
 so i don't really mind
 if i'm insulted in a foreign language
 what do i care
at least i still kept my perfume
 did you leave your perfume behind
 i said i brought it with me
 do you still have your perfume
do you remember what you promised me before you left
you don't remember what you promised me
i promise you things all the time
 i never remember any of them
the strokes could do anything and be hot
 i was going to say even if they were having a gay orgy
that would be hot anyway
 so they'd still be hot even if they

 you know who has bad hair
 but he can't help it
 he's half black
[keeps grooving to music]
i just want you to have a threesome with me
 i used water to rub it off
 but the water made it all wet
you should have used club soda
this is not a pet-friendly property
does it matter if my cat is toilet-trained
my cat doesn't have a litter box
 it uses the toilet
 does that help
i am not sure if that makes a difference
 how did you do it
i used a training kit
it might impress the owner
 but i am not sure it makes a difference
 does your cat flush
it will if that helps me get the apartment
 i want some of those
 when you're older
 girls are gonna be throwing you their panties
 i'm going to hit that raw
do you have sperm yet
 but i'll still hit it raw
it was so annoying
i hate losing money

 i wanna keep the choking hazard
so what's going on with *paige
 she doesn't have cancer
 let's get mohawks
 there goes my night
i asked weijing and she said it was ok
she must not have understood you
 she's not blond
 i'm pretty sure she understood me
what happened to your eye
some little kid poked it out
is that a tattoo
people die from those
 they get tattoos
 then they get cancer
 and then they die
i just couldn't believe it
 just because i give my child everything he wants and asks for
 she has the nerve to tell me that i'm giving my son a sense of entitlement
i can't believe she said that
i could use that cane
 i pulled my hamstring last night
 having sex with myself
you know how deodorant gives you cancer
 i'd rather take the risk
 because nobody's going to like you for being smelly
so what's your favorite element
 i guess rhodium
 why wouldn't you pick chromium or cobalt
 i just like rhodium
crime isn't going down
 it is being reclassified
 do you know where i can get cheese
may i see your ticket
i already showed my ticket
 but you haven't showed it to me
 i already showed my damn ticket

was there something wrong with the electricity
 i realized it was just me opening and closing my eyes

that show is bad
 it will take you to hell

 they have that here
 please tell me you don't go there
 do you go to church these days
 do they have in this city
and the funny thing was
 she had no curtains
 and i mean i wasn't entirely comfortable with that
 but what was i supposed to say
 "i'm not comfortable with my penis in your mouth right now"
you weren't gonna say that
i called him and i called him
 and he kept letting it go to voice mail
 maybe he wasn't there
 or maybe he just didn't want to talk to you
 it could've been jesus on the phone
 and he wasn't answering
 jesus wouldn't call on a cell phone
so she looks at it with all the sauce
 "that's not italian
" that's her whole classification system: everything's either italian or not italian
good thing the library doesn't use that system
one time i passed out
 then i woke up and was like
 "i am on the wrong line for this
" i had to get out and go back the other way
i'm such a wimp
 i take a cab when i get too drunk to know where i'm going
if we ever do go to vegas
 we have to see a brothel
isn't that where monks live
 she's like a 4x4
 comfortable and fast
 and those curves
my shit is real
i can't believe he offered us $20 for that
we should have just took it
 $20 is $20
 we didn't even have to do anything
 we didn't even have to look
 but can you imagine if those other two came around the corner while he was doing that
 they would not only think we were crackheads
 but prostitutes too
wanna go to long island tonight
 where on long island

 black plague was 
 "i don't understand how i have stds and you don't
i'll have to sterilize it and burn it or it might give the fire an infection
so i had a touch of pneumonia
 and they had to remove part of my lung

but it was clear
 so it was okay

 i'm hungry and i'm homeless
 if you could please spare some money or some food
 i'd appreciate it

 are you drunk at wal-mart again
i can't believe they took ray's fucking pizza out of the ferry terminal
 how am i supposed to sober up before i go home now
i have to move down to this end of the train because
 if i don't
 i'm gonna hit that motherfucker down there
 i know i only want to hit him because i've been drinking
 if i wasn't drinking
 he wouldn't bother me
 if i had been drinking more
 i'd just hit him
 but right now i'm caught in a strange netherworld and i'll just chill down here
 i can drink more jack through my dick than he could spill on a table
 i don't care if they call protective services on me
 when my kid turns ten
 i'll be like

 do you guys mind stopping
 i just need it chug a beer
 it will literally take me 4 seconds
i'm not ready for a rich man
 he's got money
 when michael jackson tried to buy the elephant man
 that kind of money
my daddy makes a lot of money so my mommy and me can live the life we want to live
 so he was like
 "that's what it means to be rich
 i can buy whatever makes me and my fianc&eacute; happy
 i can buy her all the harry potter memorabilia that she wants

if you're going to be in new york for at least a year
 i'd recommend going to an outer borough
 that right there
 that is new york
the subways have names and letters and numbers
 they are not colors
 don't you dare call them by colors
 they have names and letters and numbers
 the 4 is not the green train; it is the irt lexington avenue express
 the 6 is not the green train; it is the irt lexington avenue local
 an idiot in brooklyn asks for the orange train at king's highway
 it is not the orange train
 it is the f train
 he should be deported to mars for calling it the orange train
 the trains have names and letters and numbers
 and you never call 6th avenue the avenue of the americas
 i am not new york enough for this
being a new yorker is great
 you get to give the finger to everybody and nobody seems to care
 i love this city
these people must love their sandwiches
 there are so many subways here
now you are true students of fit
 nobody listens to directions
i don't know if going through water is resistance or friction

i think i'm gonna learn a lot
 they were saying things that went
 right over my head
 i'm not going to waste the credits
 i'm just going to fail the class on purpose
i'm majoring in the doggy-style orgasm

i would like to sing you a song now
 one that i wrote and i am very proud of
 it goes like this
 "lean on me
 when you're not strong
 and i'll be your friend

 is this phish

 they don't match his body
i was going to say i hope he gets cancer in his arms

you know what today is a perfect day for
so somehow we all ended up in our underwear
 then katie suggested truth or dare
 that was weird
 i had to give her a lap dance
 and sarah had to lick my tits
 and freaky stuff like that
 it was more like some lesbian orgy than a sleepover
 i thought you were gay
i don't know how i'm gonna get bernie to go down on me
 i've even tried waxing
maybe you can tattoo a little yankees logo down there
 it would be a holy object
 he would kneel and make burnt offerings
at least he would be kneeling
 that's a start
i think that guy is waving to me
 maybe you shouldn't have eaten that third piece of paper
i can't wait 'til vegoose
you finally made it

 drive to the train station
 take the train
 then take the subway to get here all for a ten-minute interview

are you selling those
 we're the police

 what does that even mean
how should i know
 i just think it sounds good
do you want to go eat korean food

i'm sayin' she used to have some good pussy and some big ole titties
 i'm talking double e-e's 
 and she went to the doctor and had them cut off
 her titties was cut off

 john lennon died for peace and tolerance

 john died for peace and humanity
 he wouldn't watch my kid last night because he was hanging out with wilmer valderrama
betty boop killed martin luther king
 the last time i went fishing i got a fishing lure stuck in my dick
everybody's somebody on my dick
can you be a little more subtle and not such a dick-swinger about your amstel light
at least i don't suck dicks for free
my redeeming factor is i will suck fucking dick to make money
take it like a bowl of dicks
so i asked her
 and she gave me her number
 and then it was disconnected
 so i went back the next week
 and she wasn't working there anymore
 so i wondered
 did she quit her job just to avoid sucking my dick
why would they invade lebanon
 we've got nothing they want

 so old testament
 they really need to come up off that shit
 i'm in manhattan

no it's all going to be fine
 we already locked up the rabbi
 what kind of racist shit is that
i was at a klan meeting when i found out i was jewish
 i just about hung myself
they were either orthodox jews or rocky horror fanatics
 other people in the middle east do not really hate jews
 we are very similar to jews
 egyptians and palestinians and lebanese and israelis
 all of us make lots of deli foods that have lots of spices and names that are fun to say
and if you are egyptian
 the war does not mean so much
 if you grew up there
 you grew up with the giant pyramids
 you know the pyramids
 well you can see them from the city
 and you think "who built those
 who did they build them for
" and then things like wars do not bother you so much
 are you fucking
i don't know; i'm out of guesses
so we fucked it up
 it's friday anyway
 i don't have to look at it no more
if you heard your name
 or something that sounds like it could be your name
 please board your plane
 it is leaving
 have your boarding passes out
 if you don't have your boarding passes out
 i'm sending you to amtrak
welcome to the parking lot known as laguardia airport
the mist you are seeing is caused by a difference in temperature
 the temperature outside is different from the temperature inside
 once we close the door and prepare for take-off
 the mist will disappear
 which will make us very sad because we like mist
 we are about to make our final descent into john f
 kennedy international airport
 so buckle your seatbelts and hold on tight
in the event of a loss of cabin pressure
 oxygen masks will be released from the overhead above your seat
 after the screaming subsides
 please place the oxygen mask around your nose and mouth
 if you are traveling with a child or an adult who is acting like a child
 place your mask on first before attempting to help put theirs on
and for those of you who wish to smoke
 and if you want to smoke inside
 you came to the wrong state
 anyone want to go to an orgy

 --madison square park
 boobies boobies boobies
 --41st & 8th
so there's gonna be total chaos on september 14th
 but that's all we have planned so far
i'd leave my wife for her if her clit didn't taste like a spicy tuna roll
i don't care how many fingers you put in her
 bottom line is
 she didn't blow you
 so i win
a blow job is better than no job
$50 for a 2-minute bj
 i'd do it
 it takes me 8 hours to make $50
 did she orgasm in your mouth
i'm thinking of getting that little string thing attached to my tongue cut off so i can eat pussy better
well if i'm not giving you head and you're not giving me head then we've got a problem
i hate eating fish
 except when my grandma makes it
 she makes it taste like beef
it wasn't just the egg roll
 jerry; it was all of last week
it smells good in here
 canal & bowery
you stick that in your mouth now before i shove it down your throat
 i bought that ice cream

 i'm sorry i had to use that kind of language on you
 how you gonna just whip out your penis and start pissin' on the train with everyone watchin'
 i had to pee so bad but i figured i'd wait for that nigga to cum
 and all of a sudden shit came leaking down my leg and he said
 you have to get that shit fixed
how you 'spect me to find you
 this map has
 so many places on it
but we in soho
which train do i need to take to get to south ho
 we have to go
there are people over there
 why are there people over there
 we're trying to get back to new york island; do you know the best way to get to 48th and 8th avenue
 is this ground zero
 it's like wontons
why don't they just call it wontons
i really wanna kiss you right now
so who does that make you: my uncle or my dad
i don't have any money
i just wanted directions
they were big for
 o-town had two hits that were really important
and where are they now
can you concentrate on more important things
 like putting your saggy tits back in your shirt
i would totally pay her back and all
but she's a fucking cokehead is what
 if anyone's gonna buy coke with my money
 it will be me
what does that mean
 that the movie has subtitles
 isn't it in english
 it's in english
 but it has subtitles for the disabled
so it's for the illiterate or something
what stop is this
what time is it
 [runs off train]
my tits feel weird
what do you mean
i did party tits at the share this weekend
 you get saline injected into them
 and they get really big
 it wears off in a few days
 the guys love it
you know what auntie cathy* said last week
 she said that
 back in the 40's
 aunt mary* was a huge slut
 and i quote
 "she had the clap so many times it amounted to applause
and i thought the only hobby she ever had was crocheting those ugly stuffed animals
i don't care what you say
 i just wanna get a big stroller and have my wife push me around
 i don't care what you say
did you hear that one
do i have to blow my ass out on your face for you to hear my farts
 i'm 8 years old
 i'm 8 years old
 it's 3 am
 we have to go home now
why are there so many mexicans in minnesota
 isn't that really far north
 how'd they swim that far
 but are you talking to yourself
 woman just looks at her and keeps talking
 are you talking to yourself
 if you are
 you should be nicer to yourself
brooklyn is a vienna-style lager
 i'm giving away a t-shirt to the first person who can name another vienna-style lager that is brewed in the u
 and i give this t-shirt to you
 except that you're a boston fan
 better luck next time
 i didn't mean to insult your computer
 i didn't know it was a cheap computer
you didn't insult my computer
 you insulted my socio-economic status
 if you want to have your dog off leash
 you can bring it in after nine o'clock at night
 that's a great idea
 i'll just bring my dog into central park after nine
 and get raped
what good is a dog if it can't stop you from getting raped
so i've always kind of wondered
you know how ants are so small
 we're probably too big to be completely perceived and understood by them
 i always wondered if there were beings that were so large they were beyond capabilities of perception and comprehension
 totally doesn't make any sense
 when it rained on 
 then get washed away
so they made fun of her
 no one would make fun of her
 she had big boobs
 so he really slept with her
 she looks like a drag queen
if she really was a drag queen
 that would be hot
that's the belly button
 it helps you breathe
i'd rather lose my legs than my hands
i could probably lose a couple of fingers and still be happy
what if you lost your dick
i'd just turn it in and make a vagina
so you'd basically turn yourself into a woman
 i'd still be a man
 but with a vagina
but you wouldn't feel anything
i'd still use it
i'm really not looking forward to getting up at 6:30 to go to work
 but remember: they wanted you to be a doctor
 i'm doing it because they wanted me to
 i'm so angry
it's like that time i had mono and sat on my stoop for three days
i swear to god
 if you tell that story one more time i'm going to shoot myself
are you ready to de-colonize columbus day
 i'd de-colonize america israel for you
so you're saying don't hate avocados
 i don't hate the avocados just for being avocados
 i would never smash an avocado
 i just want them to make up their minds
 they need to decide
 i went to his myspace to find out who his babymomma was
 and then he calls me and says i have aids
 you mean hiv
 then i get hiv
 you can get aids
 but i want hiv
my friends and i are thinking of making a movie called 'hitler is right
what was he right about
 if he had finished what he started
 there would be no more jews and the world would be better
and we wouldn't exist either
because he also killed non-aryans
 and deaf people
 i still think hitler was right
today was such an incredible day
 i met richard branson
 that's why i love you so much
have you ever wondered why there are no
 but sometimes i wonder if you are slightly retarded
 this one goes to van cortlandt
 you fuck 
 stop yelling at me
i said windows is bullshit
 i been telling you that shit for years
 my g5 is way better than whatever computer you got
 my laptop has aids
 phone your mom
 we about to go in the tunnel
 i can do whatever i want
i think i'm going to have sex with him
 you're a class act
i still have at least three years before i have to worry about being classy
that's pretty much illegal or something
they're not really related
 and she told her dad and he's cool with it
 do you wanna get some ice cream
remember that pussy i was hittin' a few weeks ago
she's in a coma now
that reminds me of that smiths song
 'girlfriend in a coma
' have you ever heard it
you have to hit a kid to teach him respect
 remember when i stole that stuff when i was younger and dad hit me
 that taught me the respect that i needed not to steal
 but not from my family
you know what would be cool
 if you guys
 wore tibetan monk outfits while you did that
 that'd be cool
when i look back on my life
 i'm not going to think about trips i went on or relationships i had
 i'll be thinking about television programs i watched
well i was only kidding
never give up 
 don't you ever give up
but why even try
 everyone loses in the end
 we're back in brooklyn
 we never left brooklyn
 the next stop is in manhattan
do you see that young man over there
 do you want his first life lesson to be me whuppin' yo' ass
so we went to a baptism yesterday
i can't believe you like going to this leather bar
 the guys here are so scary
not all of them
 there are a few gems with all their hair
 no visible gut and a strong immune system
 but she was too fat
 i can't wait to move into the city
 i can't take my house anymore
 my parents are always up my ass
 what time will you be home
 don't forget to tell rosa to pick up your dry cleaning
 we're paying your tuition
 you can't treat this house like a hotel
 it's so 
 i just wanna be on my own
 i can take care of myself
 i don't need them constantly doing stuff for me
 so where were you thinking of moving
 my dad said he might let me move into his apartment on 89th
 or a partner at his firm is selling a co-op that he might buy for me
 he said i can choose
i want a baby
you can't have a baby yet
what do you mean 'i just can't'
 you're not the ruler of my vagina
we could go by mike's
 fun mike or shitty mike
i always forget which one is which with you
fun mike always pays for everything
 shitty mike always has no money and throws up
you'd think i could keep that straight
 excuse me 
 i'm not a tourist
 don't you think it's inappropriate to be drinking gin and tonics everyday before noon
 i only drink in the mornings
 you don't have premarital sex right
nice talkin' to ya
i need to pick up my child from daycare
 where would she be
i think she's one
 look at this picture
 she never would have made cheerleader if she had two legs
so if i don't take the pill
 will i have to have a thousand babies
 that's not how it works
if we had a real house
 i'd decorate it like crazy
my worst fear is falling on a picket fence or getting eaten by a shark
 well my worst fear is someone pushing me forward onto a blackboard and having my teeth scrape down the front
 that would be awful
 i don't like homeless people
so are you gonna come out drinking tonight
 i haven't been feeling so well
 i'm allergic to rain i think
 it's not raining
 it must have been earlier or something
i had to go sign some autographs
 she's playing the saw
there is an orchestra playing
it is a tape
and she is singing
what did you say
 have a look
what a nice voice she has
she is not singing
 it's the saw that's singing
 she is singing into the saw
but she is opening her mouth
are you sure she is not singing
i used to be delusional
 were you medicated
 i had to be severely medicated
 i thought i was going to marry peter jennings
was it hard for you when he died
 i was selfishly happy because i didn't have to worry about having delusions about him anymore
 can i get some ice cream
i ain't gettin' you no ice cream
 ain't no holiday
 it's the jewish new year
so i felt really bad for him because he's 53 years old and just got fired from the one job he knows how to do
 but then he got that horse and his life turned around
 he has a large studio in soho so it has plenty of room to run around
 and now he no longer has to ride in cabs or subways
 i should get a horse too
 anna nicole's son died
 that happened like a week ago
ask him what happened on dragonball z last night and i bet he could tell you
 i missed it yesterday
 there's some fucked up shit going on
 niggas killin' niggas
it's a win-win situation
 when did you get your period
don't use that word
your id doesn't scan
 i paid extra for scanable
sorry about the delay
 i had to pee
 so i went
what did she say
she had to pee
 and she went
 get off the train or we're not moving
 you can't play here
you're just jealous that i make more than you
that susan's such a whore
 but wouldn't you be
 if you could get people to sleep with you
 there are so many restaurants around here
you better shut the fuck up unless you want to get your ass whipped in front of all these white people
but i'm still a g
 do you know what a car bomb is
 it's spanish for
 'you're an asshole
i just did it to jump start my diet
just for a couple weeks
 to lose the initial weight
and then what did you do
now i just eat half an avocado a day
that is not correct use of that word
you don't emit a noxious odor when you 'bifurcate'
will you love me forever and ever
 even if you broke up with me and shot me and cut me into little bits and set the bits on fire
i would never break up with you
 what kind of work you in
where do you work
 can you find her kid
 they got him in foster care
 i don't work for child services
 contact your county officials and explain your situation to them
yeah i don't know where he is at
 can you get him
i work at planned parenthood
just 'cause you're pretty you can't treat people like shit
just because you do drugs doesn't mean you shouldn't brush your teeth
 get over here
 she comes back to the dorm alone and crying
 and we're like 'what happened
 where did that guy go
' and she tells us that he got a ticket from a cop
 for getting a blowjob in front of the un
 a different thing than getting a blowjob somewhere else
 he had an internship there or something
 maybe he got a discount
guess what my mom told me that your mom told her the other day when we were playing
 she had another baby before you and it died
 my mom said that i'm the oldest
you are now 'cause the other one died
 she died before she was even born
 you can't die before you are born
 you can die before you are born
 while you are born
 you can die at any time and you don't even have to do anything bad
i don't want to play with you anymore
--manhattan bound f train
this is my day every day
 i sleep until around 9:30 and i get up and i answer my emails
 i work for a couple of hours and then i watch the view 
 and then i eat lunch and i basically meditate and contemplate everything for a few hours
 and then i watch 
 so i can cry my eyes out for all the poor people in africa
 then i eat dinner and i go shopping with my parents at the mall
 it sounds like a spa
 my life is like a spa
free tote bag with a purchase of a t-shirt
how much is the t-shirt
 25 bucks for a t-shirt
 stop being such a jew
you should say excuse me
i did say excuse me
what i should have said is 'don't stand in front of the fucking doors
 let's get some food
i don't have any money
 papi will pay
if you nibble his foreskin
 where do you wanna go
 one day my girlfriend will be in a good mood
 and the next day
 i don't get it
on your frickin' gyne-box
you guys were in there long enough
what about my friend beth that you met
 she had a nice face
 she had a rat face
 and i mean that in the nicest possible way
you know what is ironic
 that sign says
my dad set up my laptop stuff
 i don't know how to do it either
 my boyfriend did mine
i don't have a guy like that
 i had to set up my computer by myself
 it was hard
 to like figure it out
 i had to think
 i felt like a guy
you are so gay
i am not gay
 why do people keep saying that
 you made out with robert
 and you slept with jimmy
 i didn't kiss him
 everyone says i'm really bohemian
 i thought you were mexican
so i said to her
 'are you a him or a her
 i guess she started taking the hormones already so she said she was a she
i mean i told her i didn't care
 i just wanted to know which personal pronoun to use if i have to introduce her to someone
 how does she identify herself
i asked her that
 she said she is butch masculine
 whatever that means
 would you like some help with those directions
so you have to take this train to 42nd
what i need to know is
 do i have to be in the front of the train
 or the back of the train
 to get the shuttle
 you just ride this train to 42nd and you get off and look for the shuttle
 it doesn't matter which car you're in
 i need to get my head fixed
 and i need to know which car
 i need to get the shuttle at 42nd st
 do i have to be in the front of the train
 or the back
he's kind of cute
 i do not approve
 i think he's a really interesting person
of course he's interesting
 he's addicted to coke and he's a gay porn star and we know all of this about him and we've only known him for 5 minutes
what do you think he would do if i pushed his cart over
 i don't care if you're a girl
 i'll beat your ass
 let's go get high
 so you can make love to me
 so we can get something to eat
i think going to the gym really helps me get rid of stress
 and the drinking
 and you -- you're at the top of the list
so i swept everything into a pile and i walked away for like
 and when i come back this little mexican girl and her mom are seriously dancing in this pile of garbage and totally fucking up my sweeping
 why would anyone do that
 they were mexican
 garbage is like water to them
do you jerk off a lot
do you ever jerk off alone
 let's go in here
 that stuff's not for you
but mommy went in there
it's a store for grown-ups
 they have baby bottles
how could i snort cum
but it's so sticky
 i really don't think that's possible
unless maybe it was in powder form
 we're those guys on the train everyone wants to shut up
i need to get clothes for the city
what's wrong with what you have
 we're in new york city
 you can't wear north face in nyc
 they'll be able to tell we're new englanders from a mile away
 that's my religion
 they call it greek orthodox
but you're from greece
 it's the former ussr
 it's between russia and poland
i never heard of it
 it must be very small
it must be very small
it's the size of france
 france is quite big
i better look at a map
 do you like rap music
i'm from the south
 i know you don't know me but
 what background are you from
 why do you ask
you look like an interesting mix and i really really want to know
 i don't know
 i don't know my real parents either
 that's not true
 i just wanted to fit in
every woman should control 75 to 90% of her husband's life
la la la babyyy hey hey
 i lovee it today
 all we wanna do is smoke weeed and get drunk and be crazzzyyyy
 la la la
 this is why we should move to new york--we'd look like normal people here
that tongue twister &quot;sally sells seashells at the seashore&quot; is whacked
 why would you sell seashells at the seashore when you can just pick up seashells at the seashore for free
because it's nice and people are too lazy to look for a nice seashell in the seashore
what will they do with a seashell
 just look at it
you can listen to the ocean if you put it in the ear
why would i buy a seashell to listen to the ocean if i can listen to the ocean right there
 it doesn't make sense
 it's just a tongue twister
 it's not supposed to make sense
 just like the pickle piper shit
 it won't be that bad
 i am not fucking your sister
they'll be so impressed that you'll eat dog shit without them even asking
my friends actually pitched a show called america: who can eat the most dog shit
 basically what it sounds like
well let them know there's human interest for that
it's moderately inappropriate to have sex in the living room when other people are there
 are you loud
 you took your lord of the rings action figures to the opening night of return of the king 
 and you made them sit on your lap and watch the movie
 that was me
 but you like
don't you have a crush on muad'dib
i can't buy that
 my mom doesn't let me wear baggy clothes
i want hooker boots
 but not in the heels
 i want flats
the second smartest person in this country is ann coulter
 and let me tell you
 she looks in a pair of tight pants and manolos at 2:30 in the morning
 then i don't feel so bad about going in a little vinyl skirt if you're just going to be wearing underwear
 i'm totally ready to walk across the aisle
you expect me to spend the rest of my life with only one woman
 --42nd st & madison
 i'll show you
 you don't have to do it
 but hula hoops have saved a lot of marriages
i'd make a great wife
can i do your brother at one of your weddings

i'm saving it for my husband

i hate geese shit on fields
it's not so bad
 it's a good lubricant for when you slide-tackle people
 you just keep sliding
 i can't remember the last time i jerked off using geese shit
 it can't be that good a lubricant
 where your ass at
i went to malibu
 i was talking trash with tom collins
 i said i don't want to hear your poem today
i get mad cheap shit in chinatown

i think you should have put life and not live on your sign
 have you accepted jesus as your savior
 i'm a dirty jew
 i'm going to hell
 i just saw a bird fly by the window

 birds can't fly that fast
 it was probably a bullet
 it smells like nasty pussy here
how do you know what that smells like
 it's what i imagine it would smell like
 so i only have to lose like
 twelve more pounds
 i'll never get cast in the workshop performance if i don't break one hundred
 you should just give up now
 i haven't seen you in
 i had a baby
i didn't know you were pregnant
 i'm not gonna put another thing in my mouth tonight unless it's a cock
i'm thinking he looks more like a rabbi
 can't you just picture the yarmulke on his head
 i made you out of wood
 it is clay
 that's what makes me not jewish
believe it or not
 in catholic school during hanukkah they had us play dreidel games and eat latkes and stuff
 it was better than reading the bible
which russian mystic man has his penis on display
so are we gonna make out later
 i'm going back to la; we'll never have to see each other again
 i don't think so
 that's a maybe

madonna has the vulnerability of a cash register
she was definitely trying to get me mad

" and i'm like
 "are you saying this because i said your boyfriend looks like chuck norris
the christians are praying and not killing
 the christians only kill once in two thousand years
 or maybe a thousand years
 three hundred years
 god will forgive you for killing a hundred men
 but he will kill you because of the radio
 well that's good
 it would have been bad for your image
 don't be so angry while i kill everyone
 i kill you for a can o' pinto beans
i want that exact kind of relationship
 the whole mass murdering thing
why kill yourself when you can just steal someone else's idea
do you know how many executions i've been to over the last year
and then this big glop of bloody goop came out
 and so i reached into the toilet and squeezed it to make sure it wasn't a baby

 he cheated on his mistress
 he cheated on his with his mistress
 i was confused
so how long was your ex on the job
 he's been a cop for three years

cops get paid shit in the beginning
 he was making a lot more before
 being a drug dealer
 who has a hat
 keith richards has a hat
you on the buses
you can't trust nobody on buses
 'specially when you sleepin'
 you know how to hide yo' money
 in yo' pussy an' yo' ass
 ain't nobody touchin' yo' pussy without you noticin'
he's way too intense for me
 and his myspace page is totally black and stuff
so what do you see in him
 he sorta reminds me of brian
 from family guy
you can not date somebody on that basis
 i am not a pedophile
i'm trying so hard to lose weight
 but i'm having the hardest time
you have to cut out sugar
 that's what i do
you look really smart today
i look really smart
 because i'm putting corn starch on my wet parts
when i was a kid
 we never called people 'cunt
' it wasn't insulting enough
 but if you called someone a 'twat
' now you're using fighting words
but that's not true most places
brooklyn's not most places
it ain't halloween until you hit the ground
don't touch the white girl
give me a yellow cash card
what'd you call me
i said 'my brother
 we are different
 we're not -- we all come from the same place
 we have the same blood
 your blood is black -- your blood is shit
 my blood is blue just like yours
 if i don't come here to your store to spend money
 how are you going to afford the bombs to blow up buildings
but what exactly does that mean
 'doesn't shit where he eats'
 i'll kick his ass
it means 'not dating someone you work with
 i thought he was saying my pussy smells bad
 you never worked a day of construction in your life
 he told me that i had the prettiest pussy he had ever seen
 what did you say
' my mother told me to always take a compliment gracefully
you could just be gay
i don't want to be gay
 i just wanna be a woman
 what are you going as for halloween
 i needed a costume where my breasts could be an accessory
 makes a father proud
what do they want me to do with my students
 they expect me to be able to teach them and they are always late or absent
 my students are always getting shot or something and then they want special treatment and a make-up test
 i know what you mean -- they must be gang members
my brother drives between alaska and colorado once a year
 it's a really long drive
 i thought alaska wasn't connected to america
it's connected to canada
 it's to canada
 it's an island
 canada breaks up over there
i swear to god
 it's connected to canada
is it weird that i'm usually more horny when i'm on my period
 it's really icky to masturbate
 because blood and shit gets everywhere
have you ever run anyone over
 do you want me to try it right now
 so when he pulled it out of me it made this farting noise
 and i know it wasn't a fart because it didn't smell
 it was just really embarrassing
 the farting noise
 it's called a 'quip
 they have a name for it
 it happens to a lot of people
 that's not right
i think he's saying his name is 'queef' or something
 what's going on
i think he's one of those crazy subway guys you hear about
 i think he's telling us he's gay
i can hear you
 and i'm not
here's some money for you
 buy your boyfriend a nice grocery cart or something
 does it look like i'm homeless to you
 i'm wearing fucking ysl over here
 i ain't queer and i ain't homeless
 paris hilton-wannabe whores
 all i was saying to you was that when your sleazy-ass friend over here pulled her boyfriend's dick out of her std-ridden pussy
 is he speaking cockney or something
 are you allowed to mace crazy hobos
 i'm not fucking crazy
of course you aren't
 shut your mouth
 both of ya
 or i'm gonna whoop both your scrawny asses
 all i was saying was
 can't you see this conversation has gone past anyone in this damn subway's comprehension
 know when to drop it
 know when to drop it
[mouthing] oh my god
 that was intense
 last time i ever take a subway
 unbelievable shit i put up with
 i was just watching a tv show
 and guess who has your car
you wanna abort this conversation
because we're arguing whether 'haha' or 'l-o-l' is funnier than 'l-m-a-o
we're just conversing over here
the word is 'conversate
' 'converse' is a shoe
why don't we get off at the next stop
 --brooklyn-bound j train
 approaching canal st
so i got her pregnant
 and she wanted me to care and shit
 and i was like
 'i'm a street nigga
' and you know what i'm sayin'
 'cause you're one
 i didn't want to be a father
 i even told my son
 she was some nasty shit -- all mugly in the face; body all fucked-up
 i was lacing that shit all the way through 1982
i've never been to new york city before
you live in new york city
 this is manhattan
 but you live in new york city

 look -- white pants after labor day -- so trashy

 now we've missed our train
well it's not my fault
 just like everything else
what does this say

it says right here
 'children must behave in here
 this means that we have to behave now
stop scratching yourself down there

i can't help it if my labia itches
 are you karl marx
 i'm a porn star
jimmy* is a dirty boy
 why is jimmy a dirty boy
he said dirty things to me online
he said dirty things to you online
i don't want to talk about it right now
does he make you uncomfortable
 sometimes he does -- like
 when he tells me to send him pictures of myself with my shirt off
does it make you scared
 i just don't have any pictures of myself with my shirt off
then why don't you take some
 i'll help you
 i'll go to your house right now and take some pictures of you with your shirt off
 and then you can send them to jimmy
i don't know why
 but i've been thinking about this a lot
 and maybe you could
 help me out and clear this up or whatever
 what about death and stuff
that's a great segue
so he is definitely going to turn out gay

 all the guys in asia wear makeup
 he's only half-asian
if you were convicted of murder
 who would you send to ride to the king to get a pardon
can you spell that

 i heard that this porn star had
 lung cancer and had to
 have part of her lung removed
 always out of breath

but isn't she a porn star
 when she like

 how can she make those loud noises

 that'd only work if she was a guy and it was gay porn
 who's ever heard of a girl ventriloquist

just let me see the college brochures
would you ever eat cereal out of my mouth
 if i had that background music
do you know who the evangelists were
 i got a broken foot
 i've got a broken heart
i don't get that girl
 i just don't like her
because if i don't like someone
 i tell them
 straight at their face
 'i don't like you
' but she be talking behind people's backs and shit
 it's not cool
and she thinks she's ghetto
 but she's not

he was just ghetto
 i walked in and there were mountain dew bottles on every surface
mountain dew is ghetto
 it didn't rain the whole time i was in california

 the roads are crazy -- driving there is mad good
 they're all big and you can speed and the cops won't pull you over because there is so much other illegal-- well they got all those illegal aliens

 i just wanna know when my heatwave's gonna end
 i'm going through the changes
 and i am high

 when men take forever and a day to finish
 let's say the average woman likes five minutes of sex

 let's watch tv
we only like it for five minutes
why is it that everyone who goes away to college loves dave matthews band or o
 but they both suck
that's why i left school
 i fucking hate dave matthews band
 i hate when it's fucking raining like this
 that's why we got this blunt
 does your son have dark hair like you

 it's practically ridiculous
 i can't think of anything worse than that
all i'm saying is that if jesus was beautiful on the inside
 he was beautiful on the outside
 so i know he had ladies looking at him
 i know everything began in africa
 you know they have the indentation in africa where the devil landed
 they built a church over it to try to make it holy
 i saw it on the exorcist
 all she does is complain about how none of her clothes fit her anymore
 didn't anyone warn her
that when you are sixteen and pregnant
 you get fat
 who said that
 oh my god
i've never been more ashamed of myself
 you know that girl maria
 the one with the fucked-up eyes or the one with the fucked-up hair
the one with the fucked-up bug eye

[gasp] i bet it totally does
 i wish i had taken that class
are all new york city girls drug-addict whores
 but so are girls from long island
 there's really no difference
 can i just interject for a second here
 long island girls and new york city girls are the same thing
 it is not okay to wear tommy hilfiger sweatshirts
 and we're all addicted to drugs because we don't have gross long island weed and coke that is ninety-nine percent baking soda
 and we're whores because we're like a thousand times hotter than you'll ever be
 even when we're not wearing makeup
 i don't like this
 seriously uncalled for
 i'd rather cut off my own arms than live in long island
 i'm just high
 so don't really pay attention to me
i need you to stop here
 i need to get off and wash my pants
 there has been a sexual release in my pants
 look behind us

 i don't go to f
 i go to west point
you may think you've never even met anyone like him
 but in reality you've never even heard of anyone like him
why i be so ashy
it's because you're black
would you like to talk about greenpeace
 i only care about money
 that was some pretty diarrhea
 did you see it
it was pretty diarrhea
 we don't got that shit in mexico
do you love me
and it's gotten to the point where i don't even want to talk to anyone who doesn't own their own brownstone
my boy ain't getting no pussy
 no pussy at all
and the pussy that he is getting is pussy
didn't tupac kill himself
 he was shot
are you from florida
you sound like a cowgirl
i really don't think florida has any cowgirls
 you still sound like one
 that's where they filmed home alone 2 look
 what you talking about
 the little white kid stayed at this hotel and shit
 that's what a smoker's lung looks like
 i guess it is
 that's what a cancerous lung looks like
really makes you think twice about smoking
 i really need a cigarette
 you didn't see me yesterday
 i was in the emergency room
 patient swung at me with a cane
 so i threw a metal stapler at her
 i got stressed when i threw that stapler
 so i went to the emergency room
 we need partitions
did i tell you guys i'm going to be a father
 i'm going to be a father
i had a little accident
 now i have to get married
you know what the best thing ever is
when you wake up in the morning and have absolutely no idea what happened the night before or how you got home
 not so sure that is the best
you look like someone i know
 you look different at eight in the morning
you know any good bars around here
 this area is too cool for me
 everyone's popping out babies these days
 it's like they're the new fucking accessory
 who wants a fucking baby anyway
 you just turn into a fatass with stretch marks and saggy tits with a screaming infant who no one wants to be around
i'm due in two weeks
 is it a boy or a girl
he's a really nice guy
 he cheated on betty twice
did you just call me insurgent
what does that even mean
it's like a terrorist or something
that means you are gay
there must be a defect in your genes
so basically i didn't jerk off for a week so i could bust a huge load in her mouth
 have you ever done that
 but never purposefully
 that model has the smallest penis i've ever seen
like when i was on the bus the other day and one of them sat down next to me and i looked up and was like oh shit
 it's a he-bitch
 i had to get up 'cause i didn't want him to touch me
 i feel you
 i wouldn't want no he-bitch sittin' next to me either
i have been thinking some deep shit recently
 you fucking assholes
 i'm going to fucking kill you
 fuck you bitches
 fuck you and your mothers
 no you did not just call me a bitch
 you crazy homeless fuck

 bitch deserves to be homeless
 he should just shut his mouth and keep it movin'

i'd like some shrimp lasagna
 that's what i want to eat
how long have you had them
 they all come from abusive breeders and abusive owners and we take them in

i don't know what you're talking about
 but you go first
 'hit the hay
 or i'll cut you with my knife
 he said the 'n' word
 you like hip hop
 he was in a production of fiddler on the roof with me
 i thought he had tourette's
we gotta take down the white man
 one at a time
 he's mad tall
 we'd need mad rope
 that's so pretty
did you see the movie

 or was it
 grown in a laboratory
 why are you so obsessed with sombreros
 every time i talk to you it's sombreros
 the first time we've ever talked
 and it's about sombreros
a groopie ain't nothin' but a high-class ho
 a groopie is a ho with standards
 a groopie's no different than a prostitute
 but i respect a prostitute 'cause she don't keep it a secret
 a prostitute will fuck you for a happy meal
 a happy meal
 not even a value meal
 maybe all she wants is a happy meal
 for the toy
 don't go until the bloody hand goes away
is beirut the same thing as beer pong
 is it the same thing as beer pong
 i feel like beirut isn't a real sport

i don't think so
 i think it's like beer pong
 i always thought it was a country
what are going to be for halloween again
 a snake or somethin'
 all i know is
 it's gonna be tons of mad tight leather and vinyl
 like what's our situation
 what do you mean
like do you 
 want me to come up
what part of your ponytail makes you think i'd go home with you tonight
what is that on your sandal
it is a butterfly
 you don't know your animals
how we can get people to join us on the safari
 'come on our safari and bring back your own little namibian

 let's go get murdered in central park
we are getting to the age where we are gonna start to need us some botox
i ain't puttin' no cow urine in face

so i think my old coworker might be a widower
 i want to write a poem about it
 i just farted
 mom and dad ignore her
i i just farted
 and i farted big
 and it smells like rotten eggs
 little girl lets one rip
so how was your day
i'm not saying i wish i had a penis
 it would just be nice to be able to pee standing up
peeing standing up is a lot like eating grapefruit
 one wrong move
 and you could squirt yourself in the eye
i wouldn't want to tangle with you
i can't believe you just called me a bitch
 that is so offensive
don't be so uptight
 in the city
 bitch is just a generic term for female
 if i wanted to offend you i would have called you a cunt
i just don't get this play at all
you want me to teach you to play minesweeper
 i think we should all meet at five behind the naked cowboy
 the naked cowboy is a man
if you need any additional lighting
 just reach up and press the grey button above your seat
 passenger presses the 'call attendant' button
that wasn't the grey button
i haven't eaten all day
do you have issues with food
 i tried throwing up after eating for a while
 but i wasn't really into it
 what do you do now
i just don't eat
 this is my stop
 have a great day
 as man departs at astor place] i didn't feel threatened by him at all
 he was actually a very nice man
 why is there a line here and not on the boys' side
girls go to the bathroom differently
 you guys can just stand around and pee and make crosses
 you know -- how you and daddy make crosses with your pee-pees
 do you know stanley
you know -- he was an aircraft
that the russians put into space
i bet he's fuh-reaky in the sack
 like fuh- 
 not like normal freaky
 how everyone needs to get it once in a while
 weird freaky -- like pulling up your pants and finding the closest exit
 did i ever tell you about the ice cream
this one time he was like
 'let's have some fun' and decided to tie me up
 and then to
 build anticipation or whatever
 he went and got a bowl of ice cream
 and then i guess my damn cat decided he wanted a snack
 i can't breathe
do you mean the guy you threw up on
 but not the frat boy
 the other one
the statue of liberty
i didn't know where's waldo
 could be considered a controversial book
 some people can't find him
 what are you all standing on line for
 and what i'm really interested in studying is how computers are for us what slaves were to 19th century slaveholders
 the way we treat them like commodities
 i'm not here to bug ya'll
 but i am here to ask you for some money
 if you ain't got money
 i'll take food
you can have my lunch
what you got there
 i'm worried about my cholesterol
 it wouldn't be anti-semitic if she told you to take your stars of david off her christmas tree
i love your ring
 where'd you get it
 we just found her will
 oh my god
 when did your grandmother die
what are you trying to do
did you not see the other guy
 what he was doing
 i had to move
so he tries to kill you
 and you move over and try to kill me
what you want me to do
 you try to kill me so you don't die -- you try to kill me
 then you have to die
 that girl is hot as fuck
 i would hit that hard
 sucks she's a yankees fan
 who the hell cares
 she could have a fucking penis
 and i'd still hit that shit up
did you get off
 the weatherman retracted his 10 inches
i just want to move to another state
 like further south
 my cousin owns this train station
 we could totally go
 i have a date tonight
 you arabian fuck
do you have to use that language
 there are children present
 this is new york -- either get with it or get out
this never would have happened back in kansas city
 there must be something going on in new york today
 so ta made this problem set
 he made that genomics
 i've been hating on the wrong ta this whole time
 i didn't see that shirt
 that's a cool one
 i got this one at the show in france
were they screaming as loud as we were tonight
 we put our hands over our heads and snap our fingers and say 'ooh-la-la
what'd you have to do that for
 you don't have to fuck around with everyone on the street
what's the fun of wearing a fake
 five-dollar chinatown shirt if i'm not gonna make fun of those assholes in the process
 that can't be true
i'm dead serious -- i couldn't make that up
 you are honestly telling me that if you don't wash your ball sack
 you will grow cheese
i think sandy* has dyslexia
how do you know
 you're not in any of her classes
 but she's just so skinny
does titty-fucking actually feel good
 or does it just look hot
 it makes me physically ill
 it gives me vertigo
should i eat my earwax
you have to make a decision -- between the girls you want to fuck
 the girls you want to kill
 and the girls you want to marry
 will you take over for me
 i need a break
i gotta go scratch my booty
 i was just wondering if you were hiring staff
 but you will have to speak with the boss
 he is gonna be back in about 10 minutes
 do you have any experience
 i've been doin' this for about three years back home in sydney
 i'll put in a good word for you
 i'm getting sick of all the foreigners that they keep hiring
 it's the fuckin' statue of liberty
that shit was a present from the french
 but we still hated them hairy bastards so we sent over some biggie fries
i went to this awesome italian restaurant last night
 what did you have
this thing called 'prophylactic
i hate the system with a passion
 it's so systematic
 i want to kill its children
 we its children
 i don't know what to say to him

 dad said only if you're really good and you don't fight with your sister anymore
 he'll get you that new video game you wanted
 why'd you marry him
she is a b-and-t troll dyke

 then she's a reverse b-and-t troll dyke
'the a- of psychology'
' you're so stupid

the company was displaying won-ton negligence

are you you want the really hot sauce
 and not the regular hot sauce
want me to describe it
 it's like if i tear out your asshole and tickle it

 you don't cheat on them
 when you really love someone
 you cheat and never tell
you're so ahead of me

 [baffled pause] you think it was really hers
 i love paris hilton
 if she asks me if i love her one more time i'm going to punch her in the goddamn face

maybe you should just break up with her
 and be alone
 i just don't like him
i just don't think him being smelly should have anything to do with it
i can't believe they put up fucking scaffolding on my building
what's the big deal
once they put it up
 it never comes down
 and you never see anyone ever working on it
 you need to get laid
have you ever noticed that lemon-lime soda tastes like urine after a few minutes of not drinking it
 that's why you have to keep drinking it -- so it doesn't taste bad
 then you get addicted to it and you buy more
 it's a clever marketing scheme
has the government been probing your brain lately
 'walk like a man'

 the boys were crawling on the table
 it was great

' 'cause clearly she chose neither
what do you mean
 'to hell with this religious bullshit

that's a good place to be
 i'm not about seriousness at all
 i take everybody as they are
 i'm just trying to get laid

i'm a total hippie
that's a good thing
so say we bang

 what happened when you were 17
mommy turned to a life of crime

i think he just wanted to go out in the street and have a hipster fight about it
 they see who can eat the least amount of food

 but i don't see how that solves anything
whatever -- fucking hipsters
taking family members on a sex safari is not a good idea
it was hardly a sex safari
 i just took my brother to a massage parlor
i think my roommate is anorexic -- she never eats
 and she's lost like 40 pounds this year
my agency is the only place where i feel at home
 'cause none of the men want to fuck me

 the indian guy with the bald head and the robes

 like the more you try
 the worse-off you are
 every game of solitaire i play
 the lower score i get
 so i stopped dating him
nice thighs -- have another doughnut
and so i told him
 'i love new york
 and i'm not coming back to portland
 when you get home
 pack up our stuff and come out to new york
 you better marry that boy
 he's already married
 i'm in no hurry
so i think maybe that's the problem with new yorkers
 that's the problem
every time i see you
 you look younger
i'll remember you in my will
 your parents never kept you in a cage as a child
 the gold one is called 'cd3' or something

 so i woke up in a hospital this morning
 and i have no idea how i got there
 and i can't find my columbia id card and so i can't get back in the dorm
my wallet had everything left in it except my id card
 i asked all over the hospital and no one knows where my id card is
 i asked everywhere
do you know who brought you there
 i have no idea how i got there
 so how can i help you
how can i find my id card
maybe check with the lost and found at the hospital
 or go to id services and see if someone turned it in
i hate how words can sometimes spell other words
 i overheard that weird girl in my anthropology class talking about how she bought a glass dildo the other day
 i didn't even know they made glass ones
 i don't know
 but imagine if it cracked -- how much that would hurt
did you ask her about it
 i figured i'd just google it later
my family is full of sluts
 my sister just had a baby
 my cousin just had a baby
 my other sister just had a baby
so your mom's a slut
 my mom ain't a slut
why is that lady shouting
she's probably upset about something
maybe she ran out of pineapple and forgot to get more at the store
 or maybe her undershirt itches
 or maybe her gerbil is sick
i have a question -- what is the plural for 'clitoris'
that is a question
 you drinking tonight
 of course i'm drinking tonight
 so he broke up with you
 what a jerk
 but whatever -- it's his loss
but did he even tell you why
 what a piece of shit
 but i think it had something to do with me not liking guys or the fact that i slept with his sister
 but he didn't tell why
how about akeelah and the bee
 had enough of black girls
 it would be awesome to go trick-or-treat here tonight
 jews have halloween in april or something

it's the first floor
 'cause then you'll just break your leg
 i love you
 i don't want you to
 i just can't be with you anymore
 you're too clingy
 ten other guys
while we were dating
 it was because you're not that good in bed
 i faked all my orgasms
 by the way
 and my boobs
 --aren't water balloons
 first of all
 we're on a motherfucking-packed subway
 second of all
 being a crazy bitch isn't going to help your case
you can't break up with me
 i love you
if you're thinking of killing yourself after this
 i sell knives
how was your weekend
 when did you first suspect your mother was gay
i don't wanna talk about it
so we went out on thursday
 and he didn't call me friday or saturday
 which was good
 then he showed up at the party on sunday and didn't talk to me for the first 35 minutes
 he left me a message telling me how nice the party was
 and i haven't called him back
but you like him
 i think it's going well
do you have pancetta
we have white cetta and orange cetta
 do you have prosciutto
i better watch out -- after the weight i lost
 my mom is thinking i'm anorexic or something
 i should start eating more
 or lay off the coke
they don't have to buy clothes
[in the month of october] why is there a leprechaun passed out on those steps
 is it april fools' day
so my mother insisted on coming into the room when i had my last pelvic exam
what's worse is that she was standing near the doctor while he was doing the exam
 she was watching
then she said to the doctor
 'can i hold something for you
you are a crazy man
you are a crazy boy
what's the candy situation
 i love you
 but you don't have to tell me that when you are on the crapper
 look at all those big trophies
 there's dead people there
 you know -- you go to church
 and they put the dead person in the box
 and they put the box in there
 don't you go to church
 a pseudo-lesbian crush
 i don't wanna touch her or anything
 i don't wanna touch her
 want her to lay in my bed with me and tell stories
i want to be more like that
