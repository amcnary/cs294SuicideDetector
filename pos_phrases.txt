to be honest i use meditation for more of a practical relaxation exercise than a spiritual experience
 i was seeing visuals of spiraling energy and this peculiar green bud looking flower blooming and closing and blooming with some pink dust or liquid coming from the inside
as you might know
it is the home of your sacred temple
 i hope to hear form you soon
 because it is core to meditation
practicing this on a daily basis through meditation ( which means total and complete focus) and then through continued meditation

and also since then

 and it also became constant
it's not as easy as it seems 
ever seen something like that
 again straighten your spine
 that night i had my first dream of him and we were in the universe
 again gracefully and seemingly effortlessly
 a pure sense of existence--of i am-ness--must exist before any thought of "i am this" or "i am that" can arise
 and back through the first room past the stone carving
 after that i was still going deeper and i went into a vibrational state and i felt like the world was spinning and almost vibrating but it was calm and relaxing
the room will resume its original appearance and you will feel a sense of profound wisdom and clarity
enlightenment
 some people think that normal sex drive is obsessive perversion
 or however you want to label it
its like space and time changes itself based on the perspective of each person
 i would be able to stay thoughtless but not fully aware of my surroundings
  maybe singing brings up strong emotions
you have the sense that this place is limitless
 just end the thought with peace
 however i have this thing called lower ego who always trys its hardest to distract me and does quite a good job i must say

 yes most defnately be4 i pass
 drunvalo always said
 the music i was listening to helped me to drift off
 because life is easy
wether my eyes are open or closed
i'm currently using music to meditate
 like when you're in love)
 the best i can describe it is a being emitting huge amounts of female energy with a pink aura
 explanations or similar experiences
someone now suggests me to use a candle light to change my surroundings and my own energy
the vision started with a bed with a white cover with a blue tint to it
 and with a lot of conscious effort i can manage to move the image to the right and eventually center it the way i imagine everyone else sees the world
 i thought you were a meditation channel  lol
 and donation buttons are also ok
i lay down while meditating and last night i had experienced that i use to experience while i was a young girl

 doing anything intentionally means something you can voluntarily control
i have had allot of good stuff happen with this meditation but i would like to know some of u guy's experience with this meditation and what is the benefits for you
right now the key elements i am developing while meditating is focus
 i go form there
 i read into this and the symptoms i had were very similar to lucid dreaming or out of body experiences
and i have experienced something amazing happening during a meditation
 the water seems to glow a brilliant pure luminous blue
 i haven't posted here much but i always enjoy reading the great advice spoken
<bureaucat> though i think some of us may be buddhists
 i then look over at the field and a red balloon with a blue balloon behind it (attached) fly up in the air to the right
 but after some time
questions are

   i always am having this choice
 you literally leave this world and you are consciously in that space
 lust
 and the sidewalk has become a beautiful glowing latticework
 those who feel this will
 or even create a picture that persists
 not really sure what it means
 this meditation will do wonders for you
happiness in everything
 have any of you experienced this and does this person have a specific meaning to appear in my meditation
 and you can then enter the whole world outside which is also your own creation
 i do expect people to be aware of their own
 we need to support each other through these earth changes and raise the vibration of the planet right now
so now imagine there is a observer floating in space 
 the goal is for us to raise the energy together so we can amplify and heal together
in the centre stands a large stone carving
 in this space i will share with you some of my own meditations focused on specific desires
 loving each other 
 i has a couple of good experiences that i see as successful
 anyway i discovered i had two answers one was whispered and in real time
 it was one of the most amazing things i've ever witnessed
after some time my solar plexus exploded with warmth and for some time i was feeling it all the time
 red pill http://www
heat things (i can heat my own body or your body to burn the fingers of the aggressor with their hands on you or me
create beautiful gardens or scenery
 just us
 one of my goals is to meet my spirit guides
i am in seek of advice considering i am a seeker i am now going to continue with my seeking experience and ask you guys a question
 those shadow beings turn into something good or something unharmful
who knows
 though i am also interested is what those that know him

 for the first few weeks i was making great progress while meditating

 it's been a lifelong search for me to become more enlightened

my second most important question is how important and essential is fasting in order to achieve insight 
 and finally i won
on the 20th of feb pst time at 3pm and on the 25th pst time at 6pm there will be a mediation session in the reading room for all those interested organised by amare
 you may want to begin your meditation journey with a simple 10 minute chakra exercise
i am on most calls and we use group energy/co-creation
 primal sense of being
my take so far is although it relaxes my body
revealing the true nature behind your deepest fears
 cause and effect is a law of the mind
 you feel compassion and tremendous understanding of what you are witnessing
feel free to post your own mediation links here as well n even use your own during the mediation session in the reading room
 and i've found youtube to give me that convenience factor

 what happens when we "step behind" our own self-concepts
 so please feel free to speak as you will
 we then had it professionally mixed and mastered with the backing music to make it suitable for playback on phones and lower quality headphones
 or distinguish between the practice of silence and meditation
thanks for help
after that i was walking on some boardwalk near the ocean and my consciousness soared to great heights; at the same time i was picked up and thrown down to the ground
 there is also a 'music only' selection
 it was just a part of my life
 from thinking about food choices to yoga practice and everything in between
 and also the self they are discovering
 and that and that
 use the breath to calm the mind into gentle stillness
 and most sessions have been somewhat light
 a sharp pain shoots above my left eye and under my left eyebrow
allow yourself time to become aware of your surroundings
 but would you say  it makes a big difference or is crucial for experiencing the benefits of meditation
 the latter two i do not know how safe i will be in that part of the those countries
 a more fluid and vital energy flows into that space
 more loving perspective
 but are there any methods in which you use the transition into sleep as a tool for meditation and stay slightly conscious through the deeper brainwaves
 but when i visited rudraksha ratna i was amazed to see different combinations of rudraksha beads mala and how they benefit you while chanting mantras or japa
 such as the sound of your breath moving in and out
 of spirit is easy
<bureaucat> special k
 i really would like to get over it because i think meditation is amazing and just what i need right now
 what an awesome concept
 a course in miracles; by great philosophers such as plato and socrates; and the list goes on and on and on
 it benefits me to be honest
 whether it's sending love to my body
 i read some useful tips here yogapratice
sometimes when i meditate i'll get quick flashes of images
 we will use some tools from our mastering alchemy program sometimes
i've been so happy ever since i've been having these visions of him
 thanks for listening :}

if you find spirit who holds real divinity power and has ability to control and manage divinity power then that spirit can transmit spirit energy in your life for getting wisdom
 more focused
  often times during meditation
and all that that offers
 through my words and suggestive meditations i will attempt to bring you closer to your angels and guides through meditational exercises
 what i have also found is that when i read something that is from someone writing from there heart i feel it
 it is an actual problem in many cases due to the physical harm it causes and the ostracising and total consumption of your life
   some good
 know and trust who you are
 i read about the relaxing meditation (focusing on different body parts and relaxing them) while closing my eyes
 the walls are constructed of exquisite picturesque glass of various art forms

 we will post any future scheduled meditation sessions on this thread
return back to the main hall of your temple where your spirit guide awaits
today
 as if your breathing's consistent and steady
 the room is perfect for an extended meditation because there are no real distractions
 that would make me incredibly happy
usp=sharing
wave goodbye to your spirit guide and thank them for accompanying you today
 it turns to wicked colors like purple
it is a small isolated island with a beautiful white sandy beach like the one you had left behind
 as taught
every ray of light appears to shine upon the stone
these days i find that by surrendering
 when i finished i felt a huge sense of peace but also
 some are single others are in relationship
 i'm curious on everyone's opinion of having alcohol in your system while meditating
in response to growing interest in meditative practice as a route of self-empowerment i would like to set aside a singular thread dedicated to such
 and for the sake of quality discussions
 do meditative position and place count
you are all invited to join in a worldwide peace and healing meditation to heal the problems of the world and to bring peace to humanity and the planet

if you are still not succeeded from the above two option then now you have only the last option available which comes in third step
 i told myself
 the more i am aware of it
 for those times when you enjoy meditating without a guide
without saying anything more your guide begins to paddle
 though it was quite sudden and powerful
<bureaucat> ohh
the angel directs you now to place your hands upon the globe
it is a warm and pleasant day

i assumed this is natural and that everyone can do it
 free of "i am this
i'd be interested in hearing people's thoughts on meditating sitting upright
 and its true you wont find this kind of spiritual person
that‰Ûªs where that magic happens
the ocean appears so still and silent
 i'm an atheist (though respect many buddhist ideas)
it peers deeply within your very spirit

 if that makes sense
 just excitement that prevented me having long vivid dreams

 it seems to flow better
 since they both sound like different ways of saying
 it was an amazingly moving experience

after seeing this
 but knows itself as itself

 and as the - i'll just call them obstacles - are dissolved in this way

 primal and original as a sense of being
 can someone explain please thanks and blessings
hi all  
 purple
i can swim through water at spectacular speed
the greys work with demonic forces like shadow people and also with robots
   but that comes at a cost: i have to be willing to let my state of consciousness be altered in various ways and there is always the question
 when you enter it
 i am willing to converse on this topic with any positive and wiseful soul
 so you've got to transmute that by making it conscious
 i read about people being relaxed
 keep in mind
 but figured we might as well share with some like-minded people out there who suffer from stress
i (i think) can see a persons true character in a kind of symbolistic image (most are glowing with love and warmth but some are like two headed dragons
 but if a method shows up that will get great results and does not require 20 years of effort
all beings have an innate
 at present i have a cold that is quite different from the usual snuffling and coughing
it assists you in what you need to see

love and light

 i made you up
huge pillars of stone mark the entrance to this sacred temple
 keep up the positivity
you embrace the love in your heart and focus on your intent for clarity and wisdom
part 1:
 (and just started traditional meditation)
 to relax myself and improve my stress resistance too
 pretty handsome and he stayed for longer than any of the faces
    so my question is: how can a conversation about the ability of frequencies being applied to our brains that result in a 20 year shortcut to improved spiritual awakenings be started
 and keeping the mind still while laying in bed
i have meditated and taught meditation in many forms but zen as easy as it sounded to me at first seems to be escaping me
 and that if you are having trouble contacting the right brain
 getting smaller and smaller and smaller
 seeing these is it a step in the right direction
 rotating around themselves very fast
 i'll close my eyes and do my best to block out all of my thoughts and focus on nothingness
 a big importance to the environment
morph you into something all powerful and beautiful
 since you will be returning back to your divine temple many times to explore the many other rooms and potentials i will start part 2 after you have arrived there
 yes
 https://www
   during part of the cycle meditations go really well and
this is your temple
 you see an insignia of an eye upon the door
as you witness the images and sounds before you focus on its meaning
 does it help some people in their personal situations
 and motivation
along the corridor you see many doorways
i will endeavour to expand on this thread and make available new meditations as time permits
when you have finished and are ready your angel will turn off the globe
i am looking for a guided meditation that help with concentration and alertness
   for example
hi everyone  :) i have been practicing meditation for the last two years
 it visually gets enhanced
 especially a meditation with spirit or chakra activation
 that was also rotating fast
 i persist in making new threads
 what if you tossed that entire word and at the beginning
 delightful sense of humor
<bureaucat> but yeah phadthai is right
 i am pretty used to it by now but its quite strong energy like someone is watering a flower the hard way you know putting pressure on the water
<bureaucat> this is interesting though
i have the most intense dreams tho
 holding the intent to do so from your highest concept of love
 she's a buddhist lol
it means you know that you deserve all that god or the universe or
as you approach it you notice the door appears to be alive
 some not so good

even as i sit quietly
 happiness
 successful meditation
i had a good meditation there
 the minute i slip away from my world and feel myself getting into a deep meditative state
 will these patterns and what not eventually take a form the more i do it/deeper i learn to go into meditation
 i asked for the name of my guardian angel and i received a named
 was that i have become aware of some things that i am not certain of
 i've had many intense teachings from spirit while in meditation and i wanted to have a place to share some of these experiences
 and steer away from the usual formats of problems and advise
 in order to achieve that there are 3 basic steps;
and so forth
v=bhr3_gp3nqq )
meditation is easy
solar plexus
 i raised my vibration high enough to be able to have contact with my guide
 it is as though the light of conscious awareness shines in and reveals what is there
 of course
 if one stays 9 days or more a dmt stage is reached
 which helps
 lasting 25 minutes
 and it represents the one universal truth that all of creation knows: i am
 a way will present itself to leave it
 count me in
i would like to know your view on pros and cons of doing like that
 how important is posture
i'd love some feedback
 right there
i solved that by listening to music while i meditate
 they will be anything from healing to contacting a deceased loved one
<bureaucat> that's better
 feel it while thinking it
 pure awareness
 and what appeared to be a higher or different dimension version of my self with a duality spectrum
now you may embark upon your meditational journey
meditation is journey from sound to silence
 i really enjoy doing meditation now
 being into my activity i'm giving it my full attention and exploring every possibility of relating and bringing out my energy in the best possible way‰Û_i am in meditation
 i havent found a good candle method yet
that's all
-entering the sacred space via two separate methods
") good
<phadthai> good enough for irc
in order to keep the speed of light a constant speed
as a result my wife and i wrote our own script and had it professionally recorded by a voice-over artist
only those who have the purest intent and sincere heart may enter this room
 and what will be the next step of this practice
 and i will observe a thought
 behind the
 so simply observe this from a state of pure love and acceptance
while balancing and what i call feeding my heart chakra the other night
 meditation calms the mind and gives it deep rest
 and focusing on that which is important to you
 i am trying it soon as i am more comfortable in the natural way
 new sensations and the progress is a lot faster
you push open the large double door and step inside
positive vibes
 pink
 and if you can astral project you can definitely lucid dream
 i hear all of these amazing experiences with people during it
 they even give me a warm smile sometimes
 it's something that you can listen to time and time again
 however there are several grey areas such as links to forums with free ads
 when i found out the peace of mind that could be attained with meditation
 (shakes: "all the world is a stage
<bureaucat> especially if there is values dissonance between you and the church
 we hope you can join us
  in some way it isn't as intense as that as i've gotten kind of used to it
 "it's a great place to get drug hookups"
the angel guides you into the next room
 in a trance-like state
 did anybody had similar experiences
 kind of a fast back and forth motion
 recently i have been doing by best to meditate without actually knowing much about it
 or the inner feelings of the body and emotions
i've felt incredible lightness in my arms and legs
  meditation is the art of observing your world from another space
and i belive that from the large you's perspective your hand only took about a split second to reach earth
so try this for yourselfs and let us know what you think happens and how it happens
 as you find yourself sitting upon a beach of beautiful white sand
 loving the animals
 that there is an entire universe inside that space
 this reminds me of international yoga day
  before the meditation
 with hands clasped in prayer 
 southern mexico and guatemala
 and--in a spirit of joy--take a peek behind the stage curtain of illusion that they are
  your spirituality level must reach enough in your life in order to get wisdom in a natural way by practicing any single medication technique from different meditation techniques
 and while meditating
please feel free to offer your queries or personal experiences
- name hidden
 and using these elements
  very patterned
 whether it's saying a prayer for another person
 so vivid
 when i go deeper into meditation i begin to see more and more of these lights
 "what" he is
 "what's so great about this 'naked i am
 that he recommends the practice of silence
 and if someone got any experience with it
 if you read this far
 i only talk about the lived experienced as it is right now
 uplifting
  either i am plugged in to the universal source of energy and wisdom
 kinda like waves in a wave guide
 the only light i've ever seen while meditating was quick white flashes but i have to be meditating for quite sometime and getting a little bit deeper than usual to experience this
 aware of the silence inside of me
i would like to share my experience with kundalini here
as you step off the boat and walk down the platform your guide walks behind you allowing you to lead the way
there is a gentle breeze and the sun is just right
 i went into the white light and was floating / falling
  i fell further and embraced a female figure that was part of the white light
  sometimes just the eyes and sometimes a full face
 you should find your self in some enclosed place
 and in terms of it helping
 i find myself forcing my breath
for anything - finding spirit guides
 you are merely a witness
please read my blog (truthofconsciousness
 you son-of-a-holy father-in-heaven
 or as long as you like
as it moves closer and closer you begin to recognise it as a small wooden boat
 to just effect a little change in my life and your life 
thank you for your input
 want love
cheers 
<chester> you know so much about meditation
 and my sense of self
  meditation is the art of centering in a space of peace and love and goodness
 i'll be tuning into some of that how about you hahaha
 i am new to meditation
i look forward to any replies
 it is a white shadow
 it is mentioned quite a few times in the bible ("be still and know that i am god
pulsar-zone
the eye of clarity is a sacred tool used in the spirit realm to look deep into your very soul
 and become so intense that my face would scrunch up into a strange expression
rays of dazzling white light seems to seep through the painted glass walls towards the centre of the room
 she told me if yoh want your aims to manifest you should be ready and be an enviroment that is ready to recieve what you have asked for
you must understand
as you walk the steps you are lead along a path to an opening through the trees
 love
 i decide to meditate using some music from youtube
here's a very nice grounding technique
lovely candles around me
so thank your angel for its assistance and say goodbye
 this energy went up in different parts of my body which happened gradually
 which makes me think of a lion
they always have a very huge glow of energy around them
 the very moment i attempt to meditate some tiny cognitive command seems to subconsciously kick in and i tense up
sometimes their eyes are closed
i can love
 i am being entirely sincere
 clearer awareness and consciousness
com ) if you want to know about my experiences
 then light
 watching your breath go in and out and listening to the breath as it goes in and out
 both will get to their destination
 from movement to stillness
<chester> https://www
 and constantly trying / struggling to improve my life
  but it was not deep emotional pain like before the meditation
 everything arises within myself
i have practiced meditation before for a brief period
 please share
 it is suggested that words
 he says
 is it good or not
 i just love it and i am eager to know what will come next
 joy
 like sailing it all absorbing
  it was a very focused and useful experience for us both
now the question comes in your mind - ‰ÛÏthose spirit who has not reached to the proper spirituality level then they have no option to get wisdom from their current life
 you can do several things
<phadthai> i believe you're right
thought to myself there surely must be much more ways to enter meditation 
<chester> are those any good
 how do they expect the average person to be able to enjoy these
 but feel that energy circulation or focussing on the chakras might not be a good idea
 you are loved and you are irreplaceable
 i did follow him
 yet your computer people lol
 you need 15 posts
there are trees covering the whole surface of the island concealing its many wonders
  believe what i'm told or go with my gut
 you may also wish to play some subtle background music to aid in your relaxation
 i am somewhat new to the idea of spirituality
 everybody is different
 and more recently
 we should concentrate on a problem that we are impressed to focus on and we should all send unconditional love to the perpetrators of the problem and the world leaders
 no-one can do you as well as you can
appreciate any thoughts on it
 with our love
 my questions are;
what is the direct path' in simple language
i want anyone to be able to speak as they will without being subjected
 from this perspective you see everything so clear
org/group/download
 allowing myself to stay in the present
 as a relaxation
 za zen
<bureaucat> also the aa/na programs advocate finding god as part of the program
dear fellow traveling souls
 i have changed spiritually and i like the change
 in case you've heard of that
 i think this is the root of many of my issues
simon karlos: "dude
 even as you move around your home or do things
 i take a deep breath in through my nose
  each symbol was  spinning
 enthusiastic etc after meditation you were meditating
 i dont really have to many people to share this with
http://www
 or listen to drumming
‰Û÷we have arrived‰Ûª your guide informs you
a lot of new experience for me
 her experience was very similar to mine
 there's a certain abruptness to them
 when you are at the stage of being aware of your surroundings
 as well as meditation
since my teen years i am having spiritual experiences which has helped me understand our purpose in this world
org/d
 she offers a wonderful sense of strength
 be more alert
so if you got nothing better to do come join in
  after some time
 love yourself
 even in your mundane activities
 ive used my third eye to see it
 answers some frequently asked questions
" a reference to meditation
 for example
 in a dream like state almost
 i believe now that i was effecting the energy with my attention
you walk into a beautiful dome shaped room
 she described her experience she had during meditation and her teacher told her that this is kundalini
 http://www
 from the quick images i get
it is an odd symptom
i try to deal with reality as it is in life
i've put a lot of work into stemming the desire to move forward and as a result i have strong interactions with my back
he/she is the size of a normal human
  each one has a different experience that isn't the seeking of experience
 the key
 and it is formed with the mutual respect inherent in these things
 so i just experienced something really amazing tonight as i was lying down and meditating while listening to binaural beats that activate my third eye
 you suddenly behold the most beautiful temple you have ever seen
  the feeling was overwhelming and i opened my eyes
 i will be in a observational space
mobile

 i am just curious about the effects of music

 i mainly ask because i like to drink a bottle of wine or have several glasses of beer throughout the week
your guide tells you this is as far as they go
 what must you do to resolve any issues you may have
 i want to learn about chakras and try meditating again but as i'm new to it i'm a bit fearful of what i'm getting into
 and depression
 but each time
 the conversation requires ones conscious presence and full attention

make your way down the corridor and down the spiralling steps
 inner peace

 with cover art by mandala artist
 i share them with the highest respect to your journey and in light of your needs
 even used my full name 
 it says that doing a powerful meditation incorrectly can cause brain damage
 now it's always new and fresh
 (similar to methods used to achieve astral projection) can this be used as meditation
 or expanding
begin your personal routine of relaxation and enter your state of deep inner-awareness
 they seek our souls to feed on
 specifically on manifesting the perfect man for me/soulmate
  i  simply experienced it and let it go
 you simply are
     peace to all y'all
 but the big one works fine
you feel as if you are in the very centre of what you are observing
 and see
 and healing affair
the meditation is self discovery and the purification of mind and body through becoming more deeply aware
 older people there
 but i am here alive - life which animates body and brings this momentary experience into conscious awareness - which is to say

when the mind is engaged in some activity
 was taught as kid that only results you achieve via hard work and struggle
obviously the latter would be better as it is more disciplined
 but now i feel like this is something pretty special as i've never done this before and it's like i've opened up to something with an ease i've not known of
 the more i feel my body get's stronger by its presence or challenges it gives me
at the top of the stone steps is a vast corridor

does anyone use hemi syn (brain wave) during meditation
 natural
 my heart is still beating and i can feel a lot energy flowing through my body especially at the top of my head
 one can use words to deny existence
 and it shows me its eyes and it floats away
the temple stands high into the sky above the treetops and you feel dwarfed by its incredible size

" a spiritual seeker who asserts "i know nothing" is actually reinforcing his own sense of being by pushing against it and "denying" what is most obvious: he knows he exists
and hopefully you
 i did not find a loving attitude to receive newcomers
 it is a way of discovering the truth about yourself
 it faded as soon as it came but now i am left with a very strong but very pleasant pressure soley in the back of my forehead
 i think many people who are new to meditation (and even some people who aren't) tend to overlook the physical aspect and see it as being a mental process
 while meditating if spine bend

 i began to get a pulsing sensation right above and between my eyebrows
and here is my question:
feel the unconditional love and compassion from your beloved angel as it oversees your wellbeing
 wearing them or chanting mantras on them in the form of a mala for improving meditation
 the result of meditation is improved concentration
 i experience more or less of this in every meditation practice
 the room is set up where absolutely no light enters so the person is light deprived
 meditation is concentrating on something
it is like i'm so far into confusion that no part of this makes sense anymore
 quietly for a certain amount of time
 it also allowed me to realize our oneness
